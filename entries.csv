./Images/t0.png,Sheppard Flats,Buildings,West of Great Court,"Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners",Modernism,1960-68,1960s,"The Sheppard Flats — the first building constructed on the site, were originally conceived by the architect Richard Sheppard as the college’s ‘Married Quarters’. Tucked away on the west side of the college grounds, insulated from rowdy undergraduates by the vast swathes of playing field, the function of the Sheppard Flats were conceived, from the start, as that of housing a community of families. In a 1958 report which detailed his architectural design objectives, Sheppard commented on ‘the self-contained, introverted nature’ of his scheme for the quarters, an introversion which to him seemed ‘appropriate for family life’. At the same time, he conceived much interaction between the families living in the flats, noting in an early sketch that ‘there will probably be much visiting between occupiers’. The push-and-pull between these poles of introversion and extraversion structures the entire plan — possibly the most elegant in college — deforming and extruding the monastic quadrangle at the core of its architectural DNA. One must seriously entertain the idea that it was not Cowan Court but the very first building on site which holds the title of being the first free-standing quad in Churchill. It is also shocking to reflect on the fact that such a reimagining of an old archetype would have been radical, even impossible, scarcely 80 years before Sheppard’s plan. It was only in 1882, after all, that fellows at the University of Cambridge were no longer required to be celibate. <br> <br>

A plan based on a quad was not what Sheppard originally envisioned. His 1958 report called for ‘a group of single storey court houses’; he even intended to equip nine of these with garages. Each would have had a ‘generous living room overlooking [a] walled garden’. Sheppard's emphasis falls clearly on spaciousness and comfort. Space restrictions, however, seem to have compacted this ambition. Most of the college’s west side, after all, was to be taken up by squash courts. Compounding this was probably the fact that it became unsure whether the proposed road between Madingley and Huntingdon Roads, which would have cut through the college and served these houses' garages, was even to be built. An early sketch thus reconceives the Married Quarters as a block of flats; ‘walled garden[s]’ have been reduced to ‘private balconies’. On this sketch, Sheppard outlined some key objectives of the planned layout: among these, that the flats would ‘have light all round’, that entrances were to be grouped together for ‘ease of baby watching’, and that there should be a variety in the flat layouts (owing to the aforementioned frequent visiting between residents). <br> <br>

With the version of the plan that was built, Sheppard seems to have been struck by sudden inspiration. He was able to have his cake, eat it, and to still have some left over. The scheme is compact and modest in scale, yet seems sprawling and roomy. There is an openness to each flat, but the ground-level view of the complex is bewildering, almost forbidding. It is as if the whole building were all back and no facade. This lends inhabitants privacy and security. Furthermore Sheppard has managed to give each ground-floor flat has not just one — but two walled gardens: a front and a back garden. The first-floor flats each have a large open terrace and a balcony. The complex is an idyll of British village life reimagined for the age of the tower block and communal architecture. If Le Corbusier’s Unité tower blocks brought an urban way of life, with its streets and amenities, under one roof, Sheppard’s Married Quarters aimed to gather a village into one building — with the corresponding contraction of scale. <br> <br>

In certain ways, the scheme resembles Corbusier’s but laid flat on its side (meandering horizontals are surely the Sheppard flats’ most striking quality from a ground view). The permutation of a single basic cell, which subtly changes in layout and function depending on its orientation, might be a Corbusian echo. One enters the inner ring of flats on the ground floor (flat nos. 3, 8, 13 and 18), for example, through the front walled garden, into a long hallway from which any room in the flat is accessible. One enters the next ring (5, 10, 15, 20) of flats directly; the narrow hall, with kitchen to the left, suddenly opens up to the large living room, flanked by gardens on the left and right, accessible through screen doors. These are more dramatic in character. Those on the outermost ring (1, 6, 11, 16) are the largest (three bedrooms instead of two) and also the most open: both walled gardens face the outside world. The terrace houses on top, on the other hand, open up almost immediately upon entering to the living room overlooking the terrace; bedrooms are tucked away further behind in more private space; one turns and traverses a lobby to reach them. The originally-envisioned variety of layout has been preserved, as has the call for ‘light all around’; the device of clerestory windows — also a favourite device of Frank Lloyd Wright’s for achieving a balance between illumination and privacy — had been envisioned from very early on and eventually adopted. Receiving light while keeping inhabitants out of view, the slightly angled shape of the clerestory window frames, visually suggesting this receiving-in of light, is probably the only element of the building which betrays a certain and fussiness and over-decoration. <br> <br>

What of the shared entrances for ‘ease of baby watching’? To us now, this seems an almost bathetic hyper-specification on Sheppard's part, overemphasising perhaps the architecture’s focus on family. It seems to survive vestigially in the divided central ‘courtyard’ of the quad: four walled gardens which face each other and are accessible to each other via gates. Just as Le Corbusier’s Unité blocks grow out of the hollows formed between its series of interconnecting units — the hollows forming the axis of the Unités's internal ‘streets’ between flats — Sheppard’s scheme seems animated by this central hollow of the courtyard. Indeed, it seems as if the key to the whole pattern was unlocked when it was realised that the quad model which shaped the undergraduate courts (and indeed won Sheppard Robson the architectural competition) could also be applied to the Married Quarters scheme. The gardens are all walled off — most, apart from these four, face away from each other — but with the possibility of interaction. It is as if concentric rings of dialogue between looking inwards and looking outwards — the introversion of family life and connection with a community of families; the insulation of this community and its embeddedness in wider college life — extends in a whorl from this centre. It is perhaps a bonus that the sheer logic of this architectural balancing act results in what can just as easily have been a visual joke. The flats resemble an inversion of the swastika appropriated by the Nazis, sitting within a college dedicated to the very man who led the charge in Europe to destroy the regime that that symbol represented.
"
./Images/t1.png,Wolfson Flats,Buildings,West of Great Court,David Roberts,Modernism,1965-67,1960s,"Richard Sheppard’s original set of twenty married couples’ flats — today the Sheppard Flats — was an ingenious, elegant work of architecture, but it quickly became clear that these were inadequate for the college’s needs. The Charter of the college required that one out of every three students be engaged in postgraduate work, and by 1963 the number of postgraduates in residence numbered 101 — 28 of whom were married. It was, furthermore, projected that the number of married postgraduates would rise to 50 in the near future. It had become clear that more flats for families needed to be built. Handily, in 1962, the college had just completed the purchase of the site of 48 Storey’s Way, Whittingehame Lodge (the former home of the University genetics department) from the University for £20,250, with an eye to future development. The site was just over two acres in area and the house sitting on the site (still standing today) was then being used as a hostel for unmarried postgraduates. The solution to the housing shortage seemed obvious: a proposal was drawn up for a block of up to 40 flats for married residents on this site. <br> <br>

One major problem impeded this plan: funding. With East Court just about appearing, brick by brick, over the horizon, and several more stages of building to go, it was unclear just how much money the college Trust could divert from the main site for the postgraduate accomodation project without compromising future building. After some correspondence with the Master, Sir John Cockroft, the Wolfson Foundation — chaired by the prominent Scottish businessman Sir Isaac Wolfson — pledged £50,000 towards the building of the flats. Including this sum, a total of £123,000 was eventually obtained to construct 28 flats. There was also the possibility of spending £51,000 for a second stage of building, comprising the remaining 12. It was not much, but it would have to do. <br> <br>

The man for the job ended up being David Roberts, a Cambridge-based architect who had been teaching in the Department of Architecture for nearly twenty years, ever since the end of the war. A member of the 'old guard' at the Department, trained in the Beaux-Arts idiom, a fervent admirer of the architecture of the Italian Renaissance and English Baroque, Roberts was nonetheless one of the first architects to bring modernism to British university architecture, particularly to Cambridge. Notably, Roberts' Clare College Lodgings, completed in 1957, had set an important precedent. He had much experience working with individual Cambridge colleges on building projects. Just a couple of years before, Roberts' firm had designed possibly the most important accommodation blocks in his oeuvre, both handsome, playfully rational buildings — North Court at Jesus College, Cambridge (1963) and the Kenyon Building at St. Hugh’s College, Oxford (1964). Both are now Grade II listed. In fact, Roberts' practice had been among the 20 architectural firms which participated in the architectural competition for the Churchill College project. <br> <br>

For the Wolfson Flats project, however, economy was the watchword. At every level, a view was taken to keep costs as low as possible without unduly compromising build quality; the delay in the opening of the flats, owing to Roberts’ dissatisfaction with the quality of the interior finishing, speaks to some of the drawbacks of this approach. Nonetheless, Roberts worked admirably with what resources he had. His architectural objectives were simple. As he communicated in a note attached to his original proposal sketch: each flat should have a sunny aspect, having a view of the playing fields to the South, and each flat should have a private open space. In Roberts’ original sketch (reproduced on the left), this was achieved with a small walled courtyard for the ground floor flats and a terrace on the first floor. The sketch shows a cascade of stepped levels forming a shallow inverted ziggurat — reminiscent, perhaps, of Denys Lasdun’s New Court (the 'Typewriter') at Christs’ — following the natural fall of the site and forming a basin around the central courtyard. Later revisions cut back even on this first floor terrace, with balconies being now ‘indented' within the facade, which gave the final building a much flatter aspect, but also a more complex frontal rhythm. The unbroken horizontal bands of the original plan, created by the first floor terrace, was replaced with a more undulant play of surface and depth. Other sacrifices had to be made: a ramp which would have provided access for prams to the upper levels was scrapped. A whole wing South of the Western block of flats disappeared from sketches. Roberts’ original notes called for white painted brickwork on the outside as well as on the inside of the building; it is to our aesthetic benefit that the brickwork — local light brown grade brick, of the same type used in the Insurance Building on St Andrew’s Street — was ultimately left exposed. <br> <br>

The Wolfson Flats finally opened to residents in 1966, after some delays, to little fanfare. It is unfortunate, furthermore, that there were consistent maintenance issues in its early years, with parts constantly needing to be fixed or replaced. Until the building was retrofitted in 2010 by 5th studio, there were complaints that the units were too small, the common room windowless, the layout too inflexible. There was, on the whole, a sense that the college was somewhat embarrassed by this building. This is perhaps unfair. What emerged from suffocating budgetary constraints was a building that was sensible, functional, and — if not elegant — pleasing enough. As in Roberts’ lovely North Court at Jesus College, there remains an interest in the counterpointing of vertical and horizontal rhythms in the facade, created by the play of intersecting forms, stripped down to their bare essentials: slender, Miesian verticals (here load-bearing) which evoke pilasters, horizontal bands of windows variously shaded and recessed. The open courtyard pattern provided both space and a sense of community. The college had accomplished its goal of providing housing for its growing membership of married postgraduates without breaking the bank. What is more — Churchill now had a building designed by one of the most prolific and important Cambridge architects: perhaps not his most notable achievement, but one in which a community of families continues to live and play sixty years on — benefitting also, of course, from an ambitious retrofitting of the Flats by the practice 5th Studio in 2010."
./Images/t2.png,Wolfson Flats Retrofit,Buildings,West of Great Court,5th Studio,Modernism,2010,2010s,"Completed in 2010, an ambitious retrofit of the then-ageing Wolfson Flats was undertaken by the London and Cambridge-based architectural practice 5th Studio, for which they won an Architects’ Journal prize. 5th Studio's projects (among these: the Lea River Park in London and Bloqs, in London’s growing Meridian Water development) place an emphasis on the streamlining of communal, urban living, aligned with principles of sustainable building. It is significant that the practice prefers to be known as a ‘spatial design’ practice: taking a greater interest in ‘the parts of architecture … that you can't see’, in ‘the human experience or technical capacity rather than in what the building looks like’, as highlighted on their website. <br> <br>

The Wolfson Flats retrofit project neatly embodies the practice’s philosophy. The college had initially considered demolishing the Wolfson Flats and redeveloping the site: the facilities — initially built under suffocating budgetary constraints — were ageing, and the flat layouts themselves were becoming outdated: too small, dark, and inflexible. David Roberts, the original architect, had been aware of the problem of space from the very beginning: he had petitioned the college to reduce the planned number of flats in order to give residents of each individual flat more space. 5th Studio achieved this long-awaited expansion of living space by taking advantage of the private courtyards in the original plan. By boxing these spaces up and cladding them with cedar panels, the project architects were able to increase living space in the ground- and first-floor maisonettes by nearly 12 square metres, opening up living rooms and enabling more flexible, open floor plans. The retrofit also involved introducing more natural light into David Roberts' building: a window was created in the community room (also allowing parents to monitor their children in the communal courtyard and playground below while indoors), while the forbidding brick staircase entrance on the building’s South-west was repositioned to open up the rear elevation. The second-floor perimeter walkway was also tastefully remodelled with cedar panelling and steel mesh. <br> <br>

5th Studio's introduction of the cedar motif, to visibly indicate points of intervention with Roberts’ original brutalist structure, seems to foreshadow the more radical ‘timber brutalism’ of 6a Architects’ Cowan Court. Though some of the panelling today seems to be in need of replacement, the wood is a warm and homely material, not out of line with Richard Sheppard’s original intention in selecting the earthy brick that he did for the original college site. It is also a handy visual shorthand — just as it is for Cowan Court — for a building which takes an interest in sustainable building practices. Energy efficiency in the building, for example, was increased with the fitting of new insulation. Indeed: the entire ethos of retrofitting, instead of demolishing and building anew, falls in line with this ethos of energy-efficiency. To Tom Holbrook, director of 5th Studio, the project represents one way of confronting, working with and rethinking the legacy of the 1960s architecture embodied by Churchill College, one of Britain’s very first postwar modernist university buildings. In an interview on the Wolfson Flats project, he stated, ‘there is a magnificent legacy from the building boom of the 1960s that is just coming to the end of its natural life and needs rethinking… in an age of scarce resources, retrofitting is going to be one of the most important areas of reducing energy use in buildings’. "
./Images/t3.png,Whittingehame Lodge,Buildings,West of Great Court,Dunnage and Hartmann,Arts and Crafts,1914,1910s,"Now converted to postgraduate housing, the Arts-and-Crafts Whittingehame Lodge was the original home of the University’s genetics department Its construction of which was completed in 1914 and overseen by Dunnage and Hartmann (the firm of Scottish architects G E Dunnage and Charles Herbert Hartman). A major contributor towards the endowment for a school of genetics at Cambridge, an endowment which included the construction of Whittingehame Lodge, was Arthur Balfour — Prime Minister 1902-5. The Balfours' country seat, Whittingehame, even provided the name of this research station-cum-residence. The Balfours were enthusiastic supporters of biological research, seeking to honour the memory of Francis Maitland Balfour, once heir apparent to Charles Darwin in the minds of his scientific colleagues at Cambridge before his untimely death on Mont Blanc. Arthur Balfour was, in particular, invested in the rising tide of Mendelian genetics, a field of biological research then being pioneered by William Bateson (Francis Balfour’s student). It was Bateson himself who coined the term ‘genetics’ in English. <br> <br>
 
Part of Balfour’s endowment went towards the construction of Whittingehame Lodge, which was seen as essential for research in this burgeoning area of study. It was seen as essential that the newly-appointed Arthur James Balfour Professor of Genetics be put in close proximity as possible to his research materials: that he should have, in addition to residential facilities, a laboratory for the breeding of animals, a generous garden for experiments in plant breeding, and a cottage to house a gardener. A country estate in miniature, the very architecture of Whittingehame Lodge is a fascinating relic which reflects the roots of Victorian science in the spaces and social circles of the aristocracy. To quote the historian of science Donald Opitz on the Lodge, ‘Academic genetics was thus modeled on an older form of country-house natural history in rationale, design, and now name … The cultivation of genetics in the Cambridge countryside involved the marrying of Victorian field-based methods with the developing Mendelian experimental program that, by necessity of the research questions, required centralization of field and laboratory within a single site where the researcher could “live with his materials.”’. It is fitting, perhaps, that the Lodge should have then found itself under the aegis of Churchill College, whose architecture itself reflects an aspirational description of the institution's scientific function and technocratic ideals. <br> <br>

The house was subsequently inhabited by Reginald Punnett (of Square fame), then by the prominent biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher (in recent years controversial for his unfortunate, abhorrent support for eugenics), who dedicated part of the garden for growing Mendel’s original pea species as a tribute to the abbott. Even by Punnett’s time, however, the design of Whittingehame Lodge was increasingly becoming viewed as inadequate for the needs of genetics research. By 1960, then, it was high time for the department to head to greener pastures — specifically, a new site at the old Veterinary School on Milton Road. It was a stroke of luck for Churchill College, which was looking for space to house its undergraduates while building works were in progress. Sir John Cockroft, Churchill’s first master, had expressed interest in purchasing the site as early as 1959. By July 1961, the University had given approval for the sale of the land to Churchill after John Thoday, Fisher’s successor as Arthur Balfour professor of genetics, withdrew his interest in purchasing the site. The large gardens on the two-acre grounds, once the breeding grounds of Punnett and Fisher’s plant genetics experiments, would soon make way for the Wolfson Flats.

./Images/t4.png,Chapel,Buildings,West of Great Court,"Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners",Modernism,1966-67,1960s,"A Byzantine church in high modernist style, Richard Sheppard’s Chapel is one of the college’s architectural gems. The story of the chapel at (not of!) Churchill College is at this point well-rehearsed. Constructed in 1967, it sits on land far away from its initial, prominent Storey’s Way location which was so fiercely opposed by such founding fellows as Sir Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA. This earlier scheme — which saw the Chapel situated between the boiler house and the porter’s lodge, underwent numerous design changes, most of which looked very different from what was eventually built. One design featured barrel vaults which would have echoed those of the dining hall’s. <br> <br>

It was perhaps just as well that Sheppard, pushed by the change of location, conceived the wonderful structure we have instead. Its modest dimensions, its distinctive, squat silhouette, its earthy exterior brickwork, all conjure to mind the serene, humble grandeur of an early Christian edifice like the Byzantine-era Mausoleum of Galla Placidia (a royal tomb) in Ravenna. Structurally, the chapel nakedly evokes the byzantine cross-in-square plan (the earliest of truly Byzantine innovations in church architecture, the first examples of which were built in the 8th century) upon which it is based. Interior function, which in the symbolically-laden language of the church plan also represents a collective spiritual function, is bared in external form. The cross-shaped roof slices through the central square worship-space (in the technical language of church architecture: the <em>naos</em>) embedding itself above it. Meanwhile, an annex (the byzantine <em>narthex</em>) extrudes from the chapel’s northerly wall. Glass panel windows offer a view from the outside to the conventionally-located baptismal font within the <em>narthex</em> space. The most obvious innovation in the Church's exterior form is that of a sort of inversion of the traditional dome: the funnel-shaped pattern of the skylights on the chapel roof seem to invite light into the space. If the magnificent domes of major basilicas and baptisteries are meant to evoke the mystery of the cosmos, the skylights provide access to the thing itself. <br> <br>

This motif — this stripping-away of pretension with modernist material, laying bare the sacred material of traditional Church form — continues as one enters the space. The perforations punched out by the cross roof are paned by iridescent stained glass, beautifully designed by John Piper and made by Patrick Reyntiens. The light that filters through these and the skylights perfectly dramatises the chapel’s central volume, filtering onto the centrally-placed altar, highlighting the four slender concrete pillars which divide the space. The pillars intersect with a concrete grid which divides the timber-panelled roof into a three-by-three square: these intersections are echoed in the intersected form of the suspended cross above the altar. Indeed, the grid itself is echoed by the smaller three-by-three square created by the skylights in the center: lending the roof a fractal-like sense of recession — as if imitating the recession of the absent dome. <br> <br>

These materials laid bare — concrete, brick, wood — are wonderfully tactile and inviting to the senses: this is a church which seeks not to strike awe, but which seeks to invite the visitor to exist as part of it, to interact with it. Gone is the traditional Byzantine apse, with its hieratic, raised <em>bema</em> (where the clergy and Holy Table would have been placed). There remains a slight recession in the wall where the <em>bema</em> would have been, but this makes space for the organ. The <em>narthex</em> — home of the unbaptised, the uninitiated (the <em>narthex</em> is where these would have stood in a Byzantine church) — remains, and retains its crucial, traditional symbolic role as a portal to the world outside the church. Punched out of the wall, the square created by the narthex extends the central grid into the surrounding landscape and becomes, as a result, the foot of the embedded cross of the floor plan, its glass panels opening up a view to the outside.

./Images/t5.png,Archives Centre,Buildings,Great Court,"Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners",Modernism,1971-73,1970s,"The Archives Centre, opened in 1973, was built to house the papers of Winston Churchill. Its powerful verticals, continuing those which front the Bracken Library and unifying the building’s eastern elevation, lend it a magisterial presence. These soaring concrete mullions (echoing those found on the dining hall windows) convey a sense of security while also echoing the ordered rows of shelves — library and archival — within the building. There is something classical about the building's proportions, frightfully symmetrical, ceremonially raised on a concrete plinth. A beautifully-shaped, gracefully forbidding door, created by the sculptor Geoffrey Clarke, who also designed the gate outside the porter’s lodge, completes the design. The prominent position and commanding presence of the Archive in the great court — unusual for a Cambridge college — is fitting in a college which was always meant to serve as ‘a bridge between the achievements of the past and the possibilities of the future’."
./Images/t6.png,Pavilion,Buildings,West of Great Court,"Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners",Modernism,1966-67,1960s,"Completed in 1967, the Churchill Sports Pavilion was one of the last buildings on the original site to open its doors to students. It was the place where parties and events were held until its reconfiguration in the 1990s, and was affectionately known among students as the ‘Pav’. <br> <br>

A notice circulated in October 1967 states succinctly that the building had been ‘designed both as a Pavilion and also as a place where parties can be held’. This description is actually rather idiosyncratic, because modern sports pavilions had — for many decades since the Great War — sought to incorporate facilities for social gatherings alongside sporting and washing facilities. The taxonomy and evolutionary history of the humble British sports pavilion as a building type — and its role in the story of modernism in British school architecture — is a fascinating story that has yet to be written. See, for example, Pembroke College’s sports pavilion on Grantchester Road,  built in 1939 and extended in the 1980s, which echoes the international style of architectural modernism. Richard Sheppard’s pavilion grapples with the same problems of spatial arrangement as all sports pavilion buildings of this type, which result from the interplay between small, segregated, private areas (changing and washing rooms) and large, open, social spaces which also demand a view of the sports grounds that the pavilion services. An early sketch from 1962 saw Sheppard considering a more conventional layout — with entrances to changing rooms directly facing out to the fields, in the same direction as the entrance to a much smaller club room. By 1966, however, Sheppard had begun to embrace the more Miesian implications of what the word 'pavilion' suggested. Sheppard didn't open the building up all the way, certainly not to the extent of Mies Van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion or Neue Nationalgalerie, but he did enough to open up nearly the whole facade with windows in a manner which suggested glass curtains. <br> <br>

This rearrangement was prompted as much by several changes to the layout demanded by the college owing to the budget (the removal of gyms, for example), as by the way modern materials could meet the simple demands of the building type. What would be more natural — if the entire facade could be opened up by glass in this way — than to push the private changing and washing rooms deeper into the building (accessed now from the east side of the building), pushing the open areas right to the front? There would now be a club room in the west half and a games room on the east — both allowing daytime users an attractive view to the sports fields. The only concern, now, was noise levels: there were worries that ‘the amplified cacophony that seems essential to a party’, as Sheppard put it, might not be adequately contained by glass, and there seems to have been some pressure to wall up the facade to mitigate against this. To settle the question, a fifteen-piece orchestra was brought into the building to test the noise-dampening properties of the material. Thankfully, the glass was deemed effective enough, and with the addition of curtains, the college and the architects were satisfied that parties could go on without disturbing the occupants of the nearby North Court. <br> <br>

The Pavilion seems to have been a successful design: apart from parties and discos — table tennis tournaments, karate sessions, conferences, and even weddings took place in this space, which was extended in 1979 with new music room facilities, and then almost completely refitted in 1993 as part of David Thurlow's Study Centre project. Today, Sheppard’s somewhat bulky grid of softwood-framed windows in front of the west-half Club room has been replaced by sleeker metal-framed ones; the club room has been converted to a gymnasium. As a result, it is today perhaps too easily ignored: though it is certainly far from one of the most aesthetically successful the original buildings on the site, having been built under a tighter budget, the glass-fronted Pav is still of great architectural interest for how the unique demands of the sports pavilion building type impelled Sheppard to modify the more solid, monumental idiom he had developed for the other College buildings.
"
./Images/t7.png,Music Rooms,Buildings,West of Great Court,"Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners",Retrofit,1979-80,1970s,"In 1979, Sheppard, Robson and Partners was commissioned to design a single-storey extension to the existing sports pavilion (then affectionately known among college members as the ‘Pav’), which was to contain musical facilities. In 1980, the newly-constructed extension was inaugurated by Lady Mary Soames — the youngest of Sir Winston Churchill’s children. It is a utilitarian, unpretentious plan. A 100 metre square recital room took centre stage, flanked by three smaller practice rooms and storage areas. The recital room was supplied with ample natural light through full height sliding windows, with a view into the walled garden courtyard to the north. This general idea, in fact, has been preserved in the current Music Centre. This building would be the last in the college designed by Richard Sheppard’s firm — the college’s original architects. Though it would later be swallowed up by future additions to the site, the decision to extend the sports pavilion set the stage for future expansions in this area: David Thurlow’s Study Centre in 1993, and the New Study & Music Centre in designed by DSDHA (Deborah Saunt and David Hills Architects) 2007 which replaced it. The result is what Professor Mark Goldie, in his <em>Churchill College Cambridge: The Guide</em>, quite rightly calls a ‘palimpsest’ of architecture, progressively enlarged over the four decades between 1967 and 2007 by three different architects. This cross-temporal architectural mishmash is surely among the most unusual and fascinating architectural features of the site. Today, the original music centre has been converted into office space and training rooms for the Study Centre. It seems fitting that Richard Sheppard’s final contribution to Churchill College, intentionally or not, was taken as an invitation to future architects to join in."
./Images/t8.png,Study Centre,Buildings,West of Great Court,"David Thurlow, Carnell and Thornburrow",Retrofit,1992-93,1990s,"This creative extension and reimagining of Richard Sheppard’s original sports pavilion was college consultant architect David Thurlow’s economical response to a confluence of building needs. There was a desire to upgrade the college’s existing music rooms, built in 1979 as an extension at the back of the pavilion, to improve their acoustics and sound insulation. More pressingly, there was a need to supplement the teaching facilities in the newly-built Møller Centre, particularly a need to build larger classrooms. Furthermore, there were concerns about the appearance of the existing pavilion. Then-Bursar Michel Allen, for instance, was not a fan: he thought the existing pavilion sat uncomfortably between the Møller Centre and the college. Neither was the Centre’s architect, Henning Larsen, who in an early draft plan even suggested demolishing it and replacing it with a pavilion of his own design. <br> <br>

Thurlow’s response was to combine these needs by extending the pavilion east to create new study spaces, threading a spine through the complex to connect the new and old buildings, refurbishing the music rooms and reworking the facade of the pavilion to create a single, multi-purpose building. It was a clean, economical solution — much more so than his original, tentative proposal to demolish the pavilion and replace it with a completely new set of buildings. There is a pleasing, almost offbeat rhythm to Thurlow's new facade, a more lightweight feel that Sheppard’s original lacked, which helps it to mediate between the earthy, rectilinear solidity of the original college buildings and the Danish airiness of Larsen’s Møller Centre.  <br> <br>

The building itself pulls off postmodern playfulness even more successfully than its neighbour: idiosyncratic moments such as the single circular window on its western elevation (a reference, perhaps to the circular cutouts of the Møller Centre?), the almost comically elongated glass gable roof (which still stands out in a sea of modernist flat roofs), the incorporation of older buildings — this is playful architecture. The spinal lobby — an extension of the west-facing brise-soleil, suggests a bridging of the interior and exterior of the building, a sense heightened by the use of glass roofing over this lobby and the use of wood: plywood supported on Glulam wood beams: it is an interior which breathes the air outside.

Four storeys high and built to exacting specifications, the new wing of the Archives Centre features a prominent inscription, bearing names of donors and a quotation from a speech given by Churchill in July 1938 at Bristol University: ‘‘The inheritance bequeathed to us by former wise or valiant men becomes a rich estate to be enjoyed and used by all’."
./Images/t10.png,New Study & Music Centre,Buildings,West of Great Court,DSDHA (Deborah Saunt and David Hills),Retrofit,2006-2007,2000s,"The latest addition to the complex that has bubbled up around the nucleation point of Sheppard's original Churchill Sports Pavilion is an extension to the Study Centre, incorporating new music rooms, designed by DSDHA (Deborah Saunt and David Hills). Two main architectural objectives drove its design. Firstly — that the building should not impose itself forcefully upon the eye. The expansion of the building complex to the very border of Churchill Road, squeezing passers-by against the fences of the Storey’s Way properties to the North, would have threatened to create an architectural bottleneck along this already somewhat-cramped axis. Was there a way to maximise the building's area while maintaining Churchill’s guiding architectural principles: that of spatial openness and its sense of volume? Secondly — it was decided that the building’s structure itself should not obstruct the view of its inhabitants to the greenery outside. The building’s interior itself should incorporate a sense of the world outside.  <br> <br>

DSDHA’s RIBA-award-winning solution was surprisingly simple, and also something of an architectural anomaly for the college: a sleek, sci-fi glass box set upon a steel and timber-lined frame. The dark, semi-reflective glass cladding was deliberately chosen to provide privacy for the building’s inhabitants while at the same time reflecting the greenery planted along Churchill Road, resulting in a building that almost self-effaces. By incorporating an interior garden, a frame lined with timber shutters, corner windows, and large, open-plan spaces, featuring views through the glass-curtain cladding, the materiality of the spaces outside the building is brought indoors. Interestingly, an unobstructed view to a now-removed Henry Moore sculpture was also considered in the original plan.  <br> <br>

For all its architectural differences, there is one feature which gestures towards the original college buildings. The New Study & Music Centre sits on a concrete plinth, just as the original courts do. There is a sense of continuity here; of something new emerging from shared foundations. The roof was also originally meant to be copper-lined, like the original courts, which would have created a common visual frame further unifying two very different approaches to materiality. At the same time, DSDHA’s glass structure seems like the natural culmination of what Richard Sheppard had started with his original pavilion design, which itself gestured towards Miesian glass curtains, with its softwood-framed window-grid facade.

./Images/t11.png,Cowan Court,Buildings,West of Great Court,6a Architects,Brutalism,2016,2010s,"Cowan Court, designed by the practice 6a Architects, is the college’s newest undergraduate residential court — the only one built on the main site since West Court in 1968. Built to the exact same external dimensions as the old residential courts, the building blends in seamlessly into the college landscape, as if it had always been meant to be there. Indeed, integration into the natural landscape was a key priority for the project: aesthetically and ecologically. Built to the standards of modern sustainable construction standards, the court is designed to minimise resource consumption. This aim extends even to the design of drainage, which directs rainwater into underground storage tanks, to be used later for irrigation. The focus on ecology is also embedded in the very material of the court: the external cladding is of oak salvaged from the floors of French freight trains. The approach is very new, but the oak is very old: and it is this knowing marriage of the extremely forward-looking and extremely backward-looking which makes the court (indeed, one might say, Churchill College as an institution) so unique. Even the jettying of the building’s layers: the slight protrusion of each storey over the one below, is a conscious architectural reference to the 16th Century Paycocke house, a fine example of Tudor timber construction. The interlocking wooden beams which provide structural support on the ground floor courtyard repeat a motif that recurs throughout the college architecture. They recall similarly interlocking concrete beams (such as those which support the covered walkways) which themselves recall timber construction: another one of Sheppard Robson’s ways of softening the Brutalist idiom. There is one key way in which Cowan Court differs from the rest of the main site, though — the slight curvature of the walls. They reflect, as Tom Emerson, the founder of 6a Architects put it, ‘a kind of receiving of the open landscape’. It may very well be, as Emerson suggests, the first fully ‘timber brutalist’ building in the UK.

./Images/t12.png,Chimney,Buildings,Great Court,"Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners",Brutalism,1960-68,1960s,"The concrete chimney of the boiler house, a delightful piece of industrial design, overpeers the college’s silhouette. Churchill at its most nakedly Brutalist, the chimney embodies several architectural contradictions. Its undulant, double-barrelled form sticks out in the midst of the college’s boxy scheme, echoed only in the grand barrel vaults of the dining hall. Nonetheless the affect of its material and scale — heavy, <em>breton brut</em> concrete stacks — fortifies its softened forms, where brick, wood panelling, and shuttered concrete softens the rest of the site’s heavy-set modernist idiom. It is a religiously secular feature: Richard Sheppard’s original plans included a chapel prominently facing Storey’s Way, placed between the Porter’s Lodge and the boiler house. This scheme was famously vetoed by some of the college’s founding fellows, including Sir Francis Crick, one of the discoverers of the structure of DNA. (In an amusing letter to Sir Winston Churchill, in which he also submitted his resignation out of protest of the Chapel, he suggested that it would be just as well to build a brothel as a chapel in a purportedly secular, scientific college).  <br> <br>

Had it gone through, Sheppard’s model suggests the way that Crick’s secular indignation might have found architectural expression anyway. Towering over the chapel would have been the chimney: an industrial spire embodying hopes that, as a new, scientific institution, Churchill would represent a resurgent, postwar industrial Britain. It was no mere symbol anyway — the boiler house the chimney was attached to drove the University’s first central heating system, sporting cutting-edge jet fans tested in a wind tunnel in Harwell’s Atomic Energy Research Establishment (itself set up by the college’s first master: Sir John Cockroft). It has been said that in the notoriously freezing winter of 1963, Churchill undergraduates were the warmest ones in the University.

./Images/t13.png,Library Tower,Buildings,Great Court,"Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners",Brutalism,1960-68,1960s,"Housing the staircase which connects the college’s two libraries, this is the only curved wall on the original main site. Besides the geometry of the residential courtyards, which famously echo the quadrangular monastic courts of the city’s older colleges, this semicircular tower is another one of Churchill’s self-conscious architectural medievalisms. Its force and monumentality enhanced by the rhymes of the adjacent Archive Center’s soaring vertical mullions, brickwork lending its texture a certain earthy solidity, the structure evokes the grandeur of a medieval fortress’s corner tower. The effect is no less pronounced as one ascends the staircase from the inside, where a skylight illuminates a strangely mesmerising spatial curvature. If modernist and brutalist architecture in the wake of Le Corbusier looked to the solidity of classical forms for inspiration, Churchill’s embrace of gothic forms in the same idiom chimes with his scheme’s overall ‘softening’ of brutalism’s stark edge with a craftsmanlike rationality. 
"
./Images/t14.png,Sheltered Walkway,Buildings,Great Court,"Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners",Brutalism,1960-68,1960s,"Sure — the covered walkways are not perfect. They are narrow; there are leaks; not all the concrete is in the best of health. Nonetheless there is a sense of play in their construction that captures the imagination, compensating for the starkness of their material treatment. Despite Churchill College’s reputation for being a prime example of ‘brutalist’ architecture, the walkways are perhaps the only extensive sections of the building in which naked concrete — not shuttered, like much of the concrete highlights on interiors — is given free reign. Nonetheless, the joinery and regular horizontal furrows give one the impression of a timber structure. The joinings are satisfyingly articulated: evoking the manual craftsmanship of a carpenter. Richard Sheppard’s assistant, William Mullins, was responsible for most of the detailed design work in the college while Sheppard drew up larger plans. Here in the sheltered walkway, as in many other examples of joinery in the college, Mullins has found a way to be ornamental without sacrificing a functionalist aesthetic. Moments like these — small, perhaps obvious, but not insignificant delights — bring the college architecture to life."
./Images/t15.png,Study Centre Proposal,Buildings,West of Great Court,David Thurlow,Postmodernism,1992,1990s,"These early concept drawings for the Study Centre project were drawn up by the college’s then-consultant architect David Thurlow. More the result of him ‘playing with his pencil’ than a final proposal, they ambitiously envisioned a reshaping of the site itself. Thurlow's project proposal arose from a confluence of building needs. There was a desire to upgrade the college’s existing music rooms, built in 1979 as an extension at the back of the pavilion, to improve their acoustics and sound insulation. More pressingly, there was a need to supplement the teaching facilities in the then newly-built Møller Centre, particularly a need to build larger classrooms. Furthermore, there were concerns about the appearance of the existing pavilion. Then-Bursar Michel Allen, for instance, was not a fan: he thought it sat uncomfortably between the Møller Centre and the college. <br> <br>

In this plan, Richard Sheppard’s original pavilion/music room complex was to be demolished; in its place were to be parking spaces and a cycle store, screened off by generous planting. Thurlow's new music room and study complex would edge away from the Møller Centre. The sporting facilities of the old pavilion would be shifted to a new pavilion to the south — roughly on the site where Cowan Court now sits. If built, these would have been strikingly original interventions in the college landscape. The undulant curved roof of the study centre, its spindly lattice facade, the circular ‘porthole’ windows, were all insistent elements of Thurlow’s personal architectural vocabulary, previously seen in his acclaimed work spearheading the Cambridge Design Group, partly inspired by Chinese architecture. See, for example, the delightfully irreverent Queensway down Trumpington Road. Together with the new pavilion, the new complex would have carved out a space, with planting blocking the westward view from the Great Court, defined by curvature. Thurlow would have created what would have almost been a rival ‘great court’ dominated by a 90s postmodern style, deliberately butting up against the square-set 60s modernism of Richard Sheppard’s original buildings. Though this scheme was replaced by the more economical alternative we have today, some cameos from this proposal would find their way into Thurlow’s final design: the porthole window, the lovely latticed glass roof of the spinal lobby, the lightness of a wooden frame.

./Images/t16.png,Night Suite,Prints,Main concourse,Robyn Denny,Abstraction,1972,1970s,"Robyn Denny (1930 - 2014) was one of the most significant British painters of the 1960s. Like many of his colleagues, Denny was immensely influenced by the wave of American abstract expressionism, which had arrived on British shores with the Tate’s 1956 ‘Modern Art in the USA’ exhibition. After some initial experiments with collage work and Rothko-style colour field painting, Denny quickly developed a style which abandoned all levels of reference to the outside world, almost all suggestion of painterly gesture, built out of flat, solid and symmetrical regions of colour. Again, like many of his fellow artists working with abstract expressionist ideas, Denny exhibited in the 1961 ‘Situation’ exhibition, alongside Richard Smith, William Turnbull and John Hoyland (some of whose works are also in the college’s collection). Denny, in fact, was the exhibition’s organising secretary. <br> <br>

What Denny chiefly took away from the new American painting — especially from Jackson Pollock — was a way of suggesting and thus incorporating the body into his painting through a sense of scale. Denny’s paintings in the 60s were stood on the floor of the gallery, their dimensions comfortably fitting that of a human form. It was partly for this reason that many critics spoke of these paintings in the language of architecture: as doorways, portals, entrances. Their rectilinear, symmetrical patterns may evoke architectural plans, but they also gesture to a certain space-age, science-fiction aesthetic. Denny was an avid reader of science fiction — the title of one of his more well-known early ‘Situation’ era paintings, <em>Baby is Three</em>(triptych, 1960), is taken from a sci-fi novella of the same name by Theodore Sturgeon. Not only, then, was Denny interested in working out the implications of visual art in present-day urban architecture — as his public mural art further testifies to — but his paintings also presciently suggest the forces which would, in a digital future, push communal space itself further into abstraction. Already in 1971 the critic David Thompson, in the first monograph written on Denny, detected Denny’s ‘conditioning by the spread of mass media, the workings of communications systems and information-theory’. <br> <br>

Denny saw great critical success and enjoyed not-insignificant fame during the 60s, during which he continued to refine this basic visual idiom. He became increasingly interested in the potential for his method to illuminate new ways of working with colour, later stating of his work in this period: ‘[a]t this time, I was experimenting with what new sensations of colour can be achieved with the most limited means — what great diversity of formal experience I could make with very limited forms.’ Thompson wrote of Denny’s colouring that ‘it requires to be seen (one could almost say ""watched"") by natural light … light which changes according to the time of day… The paintings are colour-structures which change as the light changes’. It is perhaps fitting, then, that Denny’s 1972 <em>Night Suite</em>, a series of five prints which are characteristic work from near the very end of this period of his career, has been hung facing the glass of the main concourse of Churchill College, illuminated by natural light. Their positioning in a space through which visitors pass — between the Porter’s Lodge and the main foyer of the college — resonates with their formally medial quality as they invite the viewer to engage bodily with their colour-structures. Their initial appearance of visual symmetry is broken by the asymmetry of the colouring and interlacing of the surface: subtle variations of shade and composition across left and right halves fix the attention as viewers might trace how colour-structure simultaneously undermines and undergirds the work’s formal symmetry. The interlace of this tapestry of colours is woven across each print as well — the central, progressively contracting rectangular field of each takes its colour from the ‘underpainting’ (if underpainting it can be called) of another print in the series. <br> <br>

Presciently, Denny’s paintings and prints from this era find a way of completely sidestepping the question of pictorial depth: confrontational but inviting, Denny’s colour-structures are a way of involving the viewer’s body into a dimension of pure flow. It is, nonetheless, a dimension much more wedded to surface than corporeality: truly the stuff of science fiction. The year after these prints were made, in 1973, Denny would become the youngest living artist given a retrospective in the Tate. This marked the apex of his critical fortunes — it was almost as if institutional sanction had blunted the edge of his work. Denny slipped into obscurity in the following decades — though he continued to produce paintings in a style which increasingly returned to painterly gesture, which turned increasingly to an idiom centred around moments rather than flows. It is true that his 60s idiom was at risk of becoming increasingly fussy, mannered, aestheticist: by the mid 1970s Denny was ready to move in a new direction. It is perhaps the college’s fortune to own this series of prints — from this inflection-point at which Denny had stretched the language of his 60s painting to its near-limit — which so wonderfully converse with the the flows of public space, all set within the architectural modernism of a technological college dedicated to turning science fiction into reality."
./Images/t17.png,Foundation Stone,Sculpture,Buttery,Edward Wright,Brutalism,1961,1960s,"The college’s foundation stone was designed by the graphic designer and typographer Edward Wright — also known for his typographical work on New Scotland Yard’s rotating sign. The muscular typeface of the stone's raised lettering was designed specifically for the occassion. It is unimposingly placed — albeit in the college’s main foyer; the most public of the college’s spaces. Cast in concrete: the choice of material for the foundation stone spoke to the college’s commitment to architectural modernism, for which concrete was, and still is, a sacred material. To call this handsome piece of cast concrete a stone (which has been shuttered like that of the rest of the building) is to recall Richard Sheppard’s vision for the college’s treatment of this material, outlined in a report on the design objectives for the College written in 1958: <br> <br> <em>‘Concrete, reinforced or not, is the most characteristic permanent material of our time and it is our proposal that Churchill should be constructed of concrete designed and detailed to exploit its qualities rather than to hide them. We do not mean by this that coarseness should be accepted but that the material should be regarded much in the way that stone has been in the past — good for building with but which can be much improved in appearance by application of appropriate working’.</em>"
./Images/t18.png,Blue Lion,Paintings,Porter's Lodge,Albert Irvin,Abstraction,2008,2000s,"Albert Irvin (1922-2015) was one of the most prominent British abstract expressionist painters. He developed an interest in art at a young age and pursued formal training at the Northampton School of Art from 1940 to 1941. His studies were interrupted by World War II, during which he served as a navigator in the Royal Air Force. After the war, he resumed his education at Goldsmiths College, London, graduating in 1950.

<em>Blue Lion</em> is considered to be one of his later works, and it can be said that its articulation differs immensely from that of his earlier style. While bursts of energy are still present in this work, Blue Lion takes on a more playful approach to the overall brushwork as compared to, say, <em> Tarbard </em> — another of Irvin's works on display in the College, along the corridor outside of the SCR. The bottom layers of the painting are generated through powerful linework in light blue paint, creating an extension radiating from the centre, extending  out beyond the canvas itself. Meanwhile on the topmost layer, consistent, smooth, brushstrokes abstracts the shape of a blue lion with mouth wide open. Unlike conventional depictions of a lion, the canvas's shapes and pictorial elements enhance the articulation of colour, alluding to the form of a lion. Angled squares suggest eyes, a splash of pink a nose, and various interlacing strokes at the centre of the canvas forms the mouth of the lion. <br> <br>

Overall, <em>Blue Lion</em> creates a captivating, evocative realm that pleads for attention, luring the viewer into the depths of colour, enticing those who stop before it. The blue background generates a seemingly infinite spatial depth, and every stroke added on top forms a floating pictorial element, creating links between the canvas's abstract shapes. The red and orange paint creates a focus point for the viewer navigating around the work, adding a playful touch to the blue dynamic that fills the canvas. It is a mysterious, alluring, yet lighthearted work."
./Images/t19.png,Bust of Ingres,Sculpture,Fellow's Dining Room,Antoine Bourdelle,Bust,1907,1900s,"This handsome bust of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, the great French neoclassical painter, entered the college through the donation of the Maisonneuve Collection. It is to date the largest donation of art to the college; comprising mostly of early 20th-century French art. This fierce, romantic bust, in its rough and robust sculptural finish, reflects the influence of Rodin, under whom its sculptor Antoine Bourdelle — himself an important figure in French sculpture — had studied. One other cast of this bust is in the collections of the Musée Bourdelle, in Paris; another in the Musée Ingres-Bourdelle in Montauban, the town in the South of France where both men were born. <br> <br>

The statue is unique in the Churchill College collection — one of the few figurative sculptures on display (albeit in the Fellows’ Dining Hall); certainly the only one of a person not directly connected to the college. Nonetheless, Just like the Lurçat Tapestry that hangs in the Bracken Library, which was famously presented to the college as a gift from General Charles De Gaulle to Sir Winston Churchill, it is a welcome reminder of the wartime link between Britain’s French allies and the man to whose memory the college is dedicated."
./Images/t20.png,13.12.66,Paintings,Fellow's Dining Room,John Hoyland,Abstraction,1966,1960s,"Like many of his fellow British artists working during the 1960s, John Hoyland (1934-2011) was immensely influenced by the wave of New American Painting which had arrived in the UK with the ‘Modern Art in the USA’ exhibition held at the Tate in 1956. There, Hoyland saw in person canvases by Pollock, Newman and — most importantly — Rothko. Hoyland, a Yorkshireman, would later become one of the most prominent British artists working in the abstract expressionist idiom, celebrated as a painter who succeeded in lending a distinctly European, even British touch to this most American of modern art movements. <br> <br>

Rothko’s influence is on full display in this painting, which today hangs in the Fellow’s Dining Hall, which was executed during a crucial, though relatively early period of Hoyland’s career. This was a period in which Hoyland was coming to terms with old influences, absorbing new ones, and beginning to synthesise them into a completely personal language. He had already gained some artistic prominence, having had his works exhibited in the two famous ‘Situation’ exhibitions in 1960 and 1961, which brought the best and most promising of modern British artists to the fore. At the second of these exhibitions, Hoyland exhibited alongside British sculptor Anthony Caro, who was to become a major influence. Hoyland would later recall that in the mid-Sixties, he was attempting to paint in a way ‘suggestive of sculpture…more about imagined form, imagined conceptualised space’. <br> <br>

Indeed, Hoyland’s sculptural intuition was what allowed him to absorb the influence of Rothko’s colour fields while finding his own way to develop the idiom. In Hoyland’s own words, he concerned himself with ‘the ways edges met, how colours impinged upon one another, and the way that that affected the space’. In <em>13.12.66</em>, Hoyland’s painterly treatment, the thin layering of acrylic in such a way that the canvas surface and brushstrokes remain visible, combine with the richness of his colouring — luscious, pool-table green, plum, blaring orange — to work with a Rothko-like directness on the senses, provoking an emotional experience which seems totally contained within the artwork's field. Nonetheless, sentiment (Rothko’s canvases are infamous for provoking attacks of weeping) is at every moment tempered by a sense of discipline, a certain wry structural logic. The red-orange rectangle on the right appears to project itself into the viewer’s space. An effect which is enhanced by its detachment from the other colour blocks, this ‘popping out’ of the red rectangle from the contrasting surrounding green field recalls the optical trickery of Hoyland’s earlier work, but declines to problematise this optical effect. The alignment of this colour block with the others, height-wise, tempers any disorienting effects anyway. <br> <br>

The diagonal which joins the edges of the trapezoidal blue and dark green forms in the left third of the canvas is also a motif that had begun to appear in this period. In this case, it suggests but does not insist upon depth, perspective and shadow. The blue trapezoidal form could just as well have been a strip ‘peeled back’ from the lower left corner — the very possibility of this interpretation in itself imbues the work with a certain wit. In any case, the green gap between the purple and red blocks; the tentative, feathery ways in which the edges of the blocks have been articulated — each ‘impinging’ while shying away from the other — seems to disclaim the depth that the motif wants to suggest. (In this regard, it is interesting to compare this canvas to a work which shares much of its visual DNA: <em>7.11.66</em>). Perspectival depth butts against the optical one generated by the red-against-green. Indeed, one finds that by abandoning depth, the visual balance of the composition returns. The effect is almost that of turning the colour planes around in one’s head, or folding and unfolding them, until one has found a comfortable viewing-point. This amounts — almost — to a cheap trick. It is in this play that one would truly be inclined to find what is sculptural about the work, to understand how it works with a distinctly spatial logic. A fascinating picture which demonstrates Hoyland’s readiness to move towards the bolder experiments of his mature practice, this canvas speaks to Hoyland’s erudite attempt to reconcile structure and sentiment in his personal abstract expressionist idiom.

./Images/t21.png,Zelah,Sculpture,SCR/Fellow's Corridor,Denis Mitchell,Modernism,1961,1960s,"The English Sculptor Denis Mitchell (1912-1993) worked as Barbara Hepworth’s principal assistant for ten years, between 1949-59. Mitchell’s undulating, totem-like <em>Zelah</em> — executed in 1961 and carved from elm, contains a certain restless energy. If Hepworth’s four-square balancing act in Churchill’s great court evokes, with an illusionist’s touch, a balance of fragility and solidity that majestically contains its energetic potential, her erstwhile assistant here charts the eruption of a vertical form out of energetic flux. Its material and organic form, too, invites the formation of connections between it and the natural landscape of Churchill College, a site where elm trees have been growing for hundreds of years."
./Images/t22.png,Tabard,Paintings,SCR/Fellow's Corridor,Albert Irvin,Abstraction,nil,nil,"Albert Irvin (1922-2015) was a prominent British abstract painter known for his vibrant and dynamic works. His later period of art is characterised by bold colours and energetic brushstrokes. Irvin's paintings are the result of the artistic collision of contextualising experiences, and translation of movement into space. <br> <br>

Irivin’s work is inspired by modern classical music — it follows a certain compositional logic with a freedom and energy brought to life through lively performance. These paintings are paragraphs described through a specific language. Their spatial organisation serves as an underlying rhythm, while Irvin’s love of complementary colours dominates the emotional range he sets for the paintings. <em>Tabard</em> suggests a riot of energy, particularly through the dominating bright yellows and oranges. Lively brushstrokes glide across the page, vying for attention as they lead the gaze from place to place across the large canvas. Although it initially appears chaotic, longer inspection gradually reveals the structure of the pictorial surface. Its different patches of colour are divided into nine spaces across the canvas. Left of the middle, a bright orange patch dominates the frame and compliments the red square located in the top right corner. However, the borders between these colour patches are not clearly defined and each bleeds out into the other. Seemingly carefree brushstrokes create lines that invade the borders, using movement to break through spaces and generate relationships. <br> <br>

'The painting is the outcome of the struggle to paint it,' Albert Irvin once said. As <em>Tabard</em> suggests, this struggle is a process of contextualising an experience of the world. Nonetheless, Irvin’s work should not be considered a representation of the world; Rather, like music, the painting itself is the world and experience. <em>Tabard</em> is filled with an immense passion and strength that radiates from the frame, influencing emotions and generating a bridge to the viewer through a unique language that touches the mind and heart.

./Images/t23.png,I'll take my life monotonous',Prints,SCR/Fellow's Corridor,Patrick Caulfield,Pop art,1973,1970s,"Two prints now in the Churchill College collection, <em>'I'll take my life monotonous'</em> and <em>'My Life inspires so many desires'</em>, were created by the English painter and printmaker Patrick Caulfield (1936-2005) to illustrate a limited edition poetry anthology, <em>Some Poems of Jules Laforgue</em>, published by Petersburg Press in 1973. When he was offered the chance to produce an illustrated book, Caulfield himself proposed that it be a collection of poems by Laforgue, whom he had admired since first encountering his poetry in 1961. Among the twelve poems included in the book — Patricia Terry’s English translations (Caulfield’s own edition) — were ‘Complaint About a Certain Sunday’ (Complainte d’un certain dimanche) and ‘Solo by Moonlight’ (Solo de lune). The two prints owned by Churchill College are of the illustrations accompanying these two poems. <br> <br>

Caulfield’s bold palette, thick outline and his depiction of everyday objects might, at first glance, align his work with that of Andy Warhol: whose iconic Pop-Art screen prints of Marilyn Monroe hang in the Fellow’s Dining Hall not far from Caulfield’s illustrations. Nonetheless, Caulfield persistently resisted the Pop-art label throughout his career. As these subtle responses to a poet who had lived nearly a century before him demonstrate, this was for good reason. On first glance, one can already tell that Caulfield's are deeply romantic pictures. ‘I’ll take my life monotonous’ takes its name from the refrain of ‘Complaint About a Certain Sunday’, a refrain that reflexively generates a certain ennui through its repetition. The architectural rhythm of the hatched bars of Caulfield’s print — a fence perhaps — replicates this alienating repetition. ‘Oh, alone! alone! and so cold!’ (‘Oh! qu'il fait seul! oh! fait-il froid!’), sighs the poet. Even the sparrows abandon him — 'I throw them some bread; as if wounded, they depart!' (‘Je leur jette du pain: comme blessés, ils partent!’).  <br> <br>

Nonetheless, the blue wedge at the bottom right of the picture alters the perspective of this architectural view. Introducing subjectivity, the wedge sensitises us to the fact that the structure is viewed askew. It is this line of perspective that situates the viewer in relation to the series of yellow spots — the only warm colour amidst the blue — which gradually recede from view. Barred from the viewer by the screen of the fence, these yellow dots form another, possibly competing, perspective-line. Here, Caulfield strips down the formal play of picture plane and depth, that signature conern of the post-impressionist tradition from Cezanne onwards, to its starkest pictorial form. He does so through analogy with the emotional, architectural sensitivity of a great painter of interior space — one senses in his work an affinity with Vermeer, Matisse, Vuillard, even Edward Hopper. <br> <br>

In this particular case, Caulfield’s scheme, which flattens repetition and development at the same time it does representational depth, captures wonderfully the uneasily ironic, shifting mood of Laforgue’s complaint. The refrain ‘I’ll take my life monotonous’ gradually evolves in its last two occurrences in Laforgue’s poem. ‘Must life be so monotonous?’ the poet asks, in a sudden, uneasy burst of sincerity which reveals the repressed desire behind the original refrain. ‘Let’s try to live monotonous’, the poet concludes in the final stanza, hastily trying to regain his balance, seeking the solidarity from his 'fellow men' (‘mes humains’) that he simultaneously disclaims through ironic distance. That elusive object of desire which the poem circles, momentarily touches (‘She left yesterday. Perhaps I mind? | Ah yes! So that’s what hurts!’), but is never able to confidently articulate, recedes from view through this repetition. There seems to be an analogy between this slippage of desire through the poem’s contours and the obscure yellow dot of Caulfield’s print, which recedes from the viewer’s grasp, appearing simultaneously as an object in motion, and a series of separate, static ones (a seemingly naive way of pictorially representing motion that has a long and venerable history — see, for example, the purity and sophistication of its use in some narrative Christian Gothic art). Movement and serial repetition lock it in place, and bars it from access.  <br> <br>

In much the same way, <em>‘My Life inspires so many desires’</em> astutely responds to a poem about missed love. ‘We loved each other crazily, Without a word we let each other go’ (‘Nous nous aimions comme deux fous, On s’est quitté sans en parler’). Caulfield's print appears to be a representation of a curved railing. The pictorial depth of this architectural representation joins the two poles in a series. Pictorial surface, defined by the vertical edges of the frame itself, keeps them forever separate. There is a yearning in this analogy which the rich, solid blue of the background instinctively gives expression to. The precision with which Caulfield zooms into this architectural moment, his identification of an emotional analogy in a particular representation of pure structure, speaks to an immense, photographic power of observation. How fitting that they adorn the walls of Churchill College, the architecture of which itself embodies a kind of humanistic temperance of modernist form.  <br> <br>

These are structural readings imbued with a sort of romantic subjectivity which the surface appearance of the prints — bold pop-art colours, simplified schemes recalling commercial visual design and comic books — seem to finally deny in an ultimate ironic posture. As Caulfield himself wrote of Laforgue: ‘I feel an affinity with his creating a Romantic poetry and then disclaiming it at the same time, but not without pleasure. He’ll lead one up the garden path but then with the last line denies the whole poem. But it doesn’t wipe it out, it points it up.’ It is this extreme tonal ambivalence, this holding together of opposites on every level of the picture, which makes Caulfield’s prints so endlessly fascinating.

./Images/t24.png,My Life inspires so many desires,Prints,SCR/Fellow's Corridor,Patrick Caulfield,Pop art,1973,1970s,"Two prints now in the Churchill College collection, <em>'I'll take my life monotonous'</em> and <em>'My Life inspires so many desires'</em>, were created by the English painter and printmaker Patrick Caulfield (1936-2005) to illustrate a limited edition poetry anthology, <em>Some Poems of Jules Laforgue</em>, published by Petersburg Press in 1973. When he was offered the chance to produce an illustrated book, Caulfield himself proposed that it be a collection of poems by Laforgue, whom he had admired since first encountering his poetry in 1961. Among the twelve poems included in the book — Patricia Terry’s English translations (Caulfield’s own edition) — were ‘Complaint About a Certain Sunday’ (Complainte d’un certain dimanche) and ‘Solo by Moonlight’ (Solo de lune). The two prints owned by Churchill College are of the illustrations accompanying these two poems. <br> <br>

Caulfield’s bold palette, thick outline and his depiction of everyday objects might, at first glance, align his work with that of Andy Warhol: whose iconic Pop-Art screen prints of Marilyn Monroe hang in the Fellow’s Dining Hall not far from Caulfield’s illustrations. Nonetheless, Caulfield persistently resisted the Pop-art label throughout his career. As these subtle responses to a poet who had lived nearly a century before him demonstrate, this was for good reason. On first glance, one can already tell that Caulfield's are deeply romantic pictures. ‘I’ll take my life monotonous’ takes its name from the refrain of ‘Complaint About a Certain Sunday’, a refrain that reflexively generates a certain ennui through its repetition. The architectural rhythm of the hatched bars of Caulfield’s print — a fence perhaps — replicates this alienating repetition. ‘Oh, alone! alone! and so cold!’ (‘Oh! qu'il fait seul! oh! fait-il froid!’), sighs the poet. Even the sparrows abandon him — 'I throw them some bread; as if wounded, they depart!' (‘Je leur jette du pain: comme blessés, ils partent!’).  <br> <br>

Nonetheless, the blue wedge at the bottom right of the picture alters the perspective of this architectural view. Introducing subjectivity, the wedge sensitises us to the fact that the structure is viewed askew. It is this line of perspective that situates the viewer in relation to the series of yellow spots — the only warm colour amidst the blue — which gradually recede from view. Barred from the viewer by the screen of the fence, these yellow dots form another, possibly competing, perspective-line. Here, Caulfield strips down the formal play of picture plane and depth, that signature conern of the post-impressionist tradition from Cezanne onwards, to its starkest pictorial form. He does so through analogy with the emotional, architectural sensitivity of a great painter of interior space — one senses in his work an affinity with Vermeer, Matisse, Vuillard, even Edward Hopper. <br> <br>

In this particular case, Caulfield’s scheme, which flattens repetition and development at the same time it does representational depth, captures wonderfully the uneasily ironic, shifting mood of Laforgue’s complaint. The refrain ‘I’ll take my life monotonous’ gradually evolves in its last two occurrences in Laforgue’s poem. ‘Must life be so monotonous?’ the poet asks, in a sudden, uneasy burst of sincerity which reveals the repressed desire behind the original refrain. ‘Let’s try to live monotonous’, the poet concludes in the final stanza, hastily trying to regain his balance, seeking the solidarity from his 'fellow men' (‘mes humains’) that he simultaneously disclaims through ironic distance. That elusive object of desire which the poem circles, momentarily touches (‘She left yesterday. Perhaps I mind? | Ah yes! So that’s what hurts!’), but is never able to confidently articulate, recedes from view through this repetition. There seems to be an analogy between this slippage of desire through the poem’s contours and the obscure yellow dot of Caulfield’s print, which recedes from the viewer’s grasp, appearing simultaneously as an object in motion, and a series of separate, static ones (a seemingly naive way of pictorially representing motion that has a long and venerable history — see, for example, the purity and sophistication of its use in some narrative Christian Gothic art). Movement and serial repetition lock it in place, and bars it from access.  <br> <br>

In much the same way, <em>‘My Life inspires so many desires’</em> astutely responds to a poem about missed love. ‘We loved each other crazily, Without a word we let each other go’ (‘Nous nous aimions comme deux fous, On s’est quitté sans en parler’). Caulfield's print appears to be a representation of a curved railing. The pictorial depth of this architectural representation joins the two poles in a series. Pictorial surface, defined by the vertical edges of the frame itself, keeps them forever separate. There is a yearning in this analogy which the rich, solid blue of the background instinctively gives expression to. The precision with which Caulfield zooms into this architectural moment, his identification of an emotional analogy in a particular representation of pure structure, speaks to an immense, photographic power of observation. How fitting that they adorn the walls of Churchill College, the architecture of which itself embodies a kind of humanistic temperance of modernist form.  <br> <br>

These are structural readings imbued with a sort of romantic subjectivity which the surface appearance of the prints — bold pop-art colours, simplified schemes recalling commercial visual design and comic books — seem to finally deny in an ultimate ironic posture. As Caulfield himself wrote of Laforgue: ‘I feel an affinity with his creating a Romantic poetry and then disclaiming it at the same time, but not without pleasure. He’ll lead one up the garden path but then with the last line denies the whole poem. But it doesn’t wipe it out, it points it up.’ It is this extreme tonal ambivalence, this holding together of opposites on every level of the picture, which makes Caulfield’s prints so endlessly fascinating.

./Images/t25.png,Untitled,Prints,SCR/Fellow's Corridor,John Hoyland,Abstraction,1972,1970s,"Like many of his fellow British artists working during the 1960s, John Hoyland (1934-2011) was immensely influenced by the wave of New American Painting which arrived on UK shores with the ‘Modern Art in the USA’ exhibition, held at the Tate in 1956. There, Hoyland saw in person canvases by Pollock, Newman and — most importantly — Rothko. Hoyland, a Yorkshireman, would later become one of the most prominent British artists working in the abstract expressionist idiom, celebrated as a painter who succeeded in lending a distinctly European, even British, touch to this most American of modern art movements. <br> <br>

Hoyland’s tendency to title his paintings after their (supposed) dates of completion suggests a method embedded with a sense of process, with change and development over time. There is something austere, even monastic, about this — a meeting-point between diaristic subjectivity and scientific orderliness which also reflects the frisson of formal containment against emotional boundlessness in Hoyland's works. In this print, executed in 1972 (when Hoyland was spending much more time painting in New York). we see Hoyland tinkering with a form which seems to have captivated his imagination in this period: an ‘L’ shaped block, a rectangle with one of its corners taken out. This shape is a motif, a familiar, structuring figment, that recurs in Hoyland's work of this period. This is also when he began to explore different, more delicate palettes, while at the same time continuing his experiments, which began in the late 1960s, with a more daring way of layering acrylics. In the works of the 60s-70s Hoyland allowed paint to drip down and splash more freely across the canvas as he constantly grappled towards new ways of texturing his surfaces. <br> <br>

In this print, however, focus falls on form rather than texture. Its conception is not complete, but it is, perhaps, not supposed to be — in the way none of his paintings are. The whole pictorial scheme of shape and colouring seems to arise from the pink ‘L’ shaped form, radiating out from its dominating presence. There is something tentative about this study, what seems to be the result of Hoyland studying the potential and fecundity of this form, its expressive possibility. There is humility and generosity in Hoyland’s openness about artistic process; that the rigour and meditativeness of this process comes through, even in a print, speaks to his artistic success.

./Images/t26.png,Regarding Guardian (Fire),Sculpture,SCR/Fellow's Corridor,Dhruva Mistry,Postmodernism,nil,1980s,"Mistry moved to England in 1981 to study at the Royal College of Art, residing and working there until his return to India in 1997. His European experience fostered a hybrid style in his work, merging references to Asian deities with European modernism, particularly influenced by Julio Gonzalez and Pablo Picasso. Andrew Wilson has emphasised Picasso's significant impact on Mistry's 'Spatial Diagram' sculptures, noting that they illustrate 'the extent to which Mistry’s approach to the body draws from Picasso’s paintings of bathers on the beach, known as the ""Bone Women"", created in Dinard, Cannes, and Paris between 1927 and 1930, as well as sculptures like ""Head of a Woman"" and ""Bust of a Woman"" produced in Boisgeloup in 1932.' <br> <br>

Mistry had a great passion for researching ancient cultures such as those of India, Assyria, Egypt and Greece. Some of his sculptures are remnants of mystical figures, described as half-beast gods in ancient tales. <em>Regarding Guardian (Fire)</em>, part of Mistry’s “Regarding Guardian” series of sculptures, is an orange and red beast suggesting both mystical and Indian origins. "
./Images/t27.png,Unknown title,Prints,SCR/Fellow's Corridor,Louise Nevelson,Abstraction,1971 (?),1970s,"One would be forgiven for taking this Louise Nevelson print for a work by another artist. Nevelson (1899-1988) was one of the foremost American abstract expressionist sculptors, an unfortunately rare exception in the male-dominated American art world of her time. She is famous for her black, monochrome wall sculptures and bricolages, whose visual vocabulary might seem rather divorced from that of this print. Nonetheless, Nevelson was also a prominent printmaker. She would test formal ideas in her prints before executing them in her sculpture, while also experimented with innovative techniques in her printmaking and lithographic practice itself. Moving away from traditional ‘subtractive’ processes of carving, Nevelson would incorporate novel ‘additive’ methods in her abstract prints, such as the use of lace, to create forms <em>intaglio</em>. <br> <br>

This untitled 1971 print bears clear affinities with the lithographs Nevelson produced during one of her last residencies, in 1967, at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop (now the Tamarind Institute). The bold use of scarlet planes, mediating between black and white forms, is a motif that Nevelson introduced to her lithography during this residency. This later 1971 work also illuminates how Nevelson’s sculptural practice, and her recurrent formal concerns, itself bled into her printmaking technique. <br> <br>

In the print, Nevelson builds up layers of form and colour with an almost representational logic — more so than any of her other prints of the late 60s. One sees in it a characteristic play of forms forced to interact and deform, jostling within the confines of the frame — evident in such early experimental sketches such as her <em>Two Seated Nudes</em> (c. 1930). Also present are the characteristic rounded, softened rectangular boundaries of those modular forms, introduced to her visual vocabulary after she encountered Maya art for the first time, during a series of visits in the 1950s to excavated pre-Columbian sites such as Uxmal, Chichen Itza and Quiriga. Indeed, the simple representational logic of this print — of a bright white peeking out from an aperture created by a progressively darkening series of layered planes — seems almost to evoke a natural scene from one of these trips. There is certainly an affinity here with the way light is filtered through the trunks and foliage of the Guatemalan rainforest. This was an environment that Nevelson persistently returned to years after the trip, in works such as <em>Night Landscape</em> (1955) and <em>Tropical Rain Forest</em> (1967). Nevelson's affinity with the rainforest even emerges in the materiality of her sculptures: their main sculptural material was wood. In the 70s, light itself also became an important material to Nevelson, as she began experiments in Plexiglas (see her transparent sculptures) and in her ‘Atmosphere and Environment’ series. These 'Atmosphere and Environment' sculptures, with their lattice-like forms, invited viewers to perceive them as screens through which light, and a view of their surrounding environment, could pass.  <br> <br>

The attractiveness of this 1971 print, that hangs in the Fellows’ Corridor in Churchill College today, lies in the way it transplants this volumetric experience of nature — with exceptional clarity of mind and simplicity — onto two-dimensional surface. Nevelson grasps the abstract contours of this experience with unaffected ease. In this way, this late print of Nevelson’s, executed at the height of her fame, owes its luminous effect to the increasingly close marriage of some of her most persistent formal concerns to ecological and environmental motifs. Nevelson's abstract print signifies a return to a more explicitly representational attitude towards the experience — if not the material <em>bricolage</em> — of being in nature.

./Images/t28.png,Étoile de Paris,Tapestry,Bracken Library,Jean Lurçat,Surrealism,nil,1940s,"As the commemorative plaque below informs us, this sumptuous, radiant tapestry was a personal gift from Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French and president of the French Fifth Republic, to Winston Churchill. Churchill wrote in a letter of 1961 — the year of de Gaulle’s gift — of being touched by de Gaulle’s continuing friendship, and how important their wartime comradeship had been to him. Even through this friendship, however, de Gaulle’s gift characteristically reflects a fierce, patriotic independence: notoriously, one of the verses woven into this tapestry by the artist Jean Lurçat — who himself had been part of the French resistance — contains the lines ‘Paris Paris soi-même libéré’/‘Paris self-liberated’ (on which more later). Britain itself had diplomatically sat out of the liberation of Paris, which was achieved by French and American troops; General Eisenhower had agreed that the French column would be the first to march into the city. After the embarrassments of Dien Bien Phu in 1954 and the Suez crisis in 1956, France would then grow wary of overreliance on her Western allies. In 1966, de Gaulle would withdraw the country from NATO’s military command structure, a bold assertion of France’s ability to — in some way — stand alone. <br> <br>

How curious, then, that the hanging of Lurçat’s tapestry — perfectly integrated into the architecture of the Bracken Library, yet completely dominating the visual experience of the space — seems to exist at precisely this junction: the intersection between the (political) vectors of embeddedness and autonomy. These forces meet, circulate, and radiate from the work like automobiles around the arc du Triomphe on the Place de l’Étoile, from which this tapestry took its name (the Place was renamed, in 1970, Place Charles de Gaulle). A delightful graphic of the Place as a starburst is woven in yellow thread on the left of the tapestry. Such bursts of light and burning suns are motifs which dominate the surrealist vistas of Lurçat, pioneer of modern tapestry, who was drawn to this approach through the art of such French symbolists as Odilion Redon. Also featured on this tapestry is the proud Gallic Rooster, another of his recurrent motifs. The conjunction of these two symbols transforms each — this monumental fabric is a celebration of radiant French power, encapsulated in the cathartic event of the liberation of Paris. <br> <br>

The point is driven home by the verses woven into the tapestry, three out of four of which were composed in 1944, in the months surrounding the dramatic events of the liberation of Paris. Starting from the bottom left, there are four lines by the surrealist poet Paul Eluard, from his poem ‘Chant du feu vainqueur du feu’ (Song of Fire Conqueror of Fire):
<blockquote><em>
Un feu clair jusqu’à l’essence <br>
De toutes les formes nues <br>
Un feu clair dans le filet <br>
Des lueurs et des couleurs <br> <br>
(A clear fire until the essence | of all naked forms | A clear fire in the net | of glints and colours) </em> </blockquote>
This rarefying violence, a sort of purifying blaze, is taken up again by the next verses up, above the green slab. These lines were composed by the lesser-known poet and philosopher Jean Marcenac, and probably found their way here because Marcenac's poem, ‘Le 17 Juin 1944’, was explicitly dedicated to Lurçat himself:
<blockquote><em>
Entre Assieds-toi Et rends la justice solaire <br>
Pour que ce feu reste sur terre. <br> <br>

(Enter Sit And render solar justice | So that this fire might remain on the earth) </em></blockquote>The blaze embodied in Lurçat's suns is nothing but the moral force of justice itself. This was a sense of impending justice that was in the air during those few restless months before the liberation; the German position in Europe buckling, Resistance fighters in Paris twitching for action. As Eluard’s fellow surrealist Louis Aragon put it in his poem ‘Paris’ — ‘L’air est alcool et le malheur courage’  (The air is alcohol and tragedy courage). And it is the bitterly, cathartically triumphant final lines of this poem which are woven above Marcenac's:
<blockquote><em>
Rien n’est si grand qu’un linceul déchiré<br> 
Paris Paris soi-même libéré <br> <br>

(Nothing is so beautiful as a torn shroud | Paris Paris self-liberated) </em></blockquote>The torn shroud is usually taken as a representation of the broken German occupation — and indeed, the line before this speaks of ‘ce cri de mon peuple vainqueur’ (this cry of my conquering people). Solar justice has rent this shroud and let in the light. It is important to note how important and prevalent this sense of self-liberation was. There was a strong belief, among the French people immediately after the war, that it was the Resistance itself that had liberated Paris (within the city walls, the Resistance had indeed played a key role in the events of August 1944). And if de Gaulle gifted Churchill a work of art which featured these verses as a backhanded assertion of French self-reliance, it is also represents him acknowledging (or perhaps co-opting) the message of a poet on the other side of the political aisle. As a member of the communist faction in the French resistance, Aragon had in fact opposed the pro-Gaullist faction, prerogatively labelled 'attentistes' by the pro-Communists. This nickname derives from the French verb attendre — 'to wait' — because the Gaullists were perceived as merely waiting for Anglo-American forces to step in. Aluard consistently attacked the attentistes in his war poetry, advocating instead for urgent, immediate action, particularly the liberation of individual areas in France by local populations. The formula of self-liberation points to this political goal, as in his ‘Marche française’: ‘II faut libérer ce qu’on aime | Soi-même soi-même soi-même’ (One must liberate what one loves | oneself, oneself, oneself). Counterpointing this militancy, however, are the verses at the very top of the tapestry. These are taken from a famous medieval song in the Occitan dialect, composed by the troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn: 
<blockquote><em>
Non es meravelha s’ieu chan <br>
Mielhs de nulh autre chantador, <br>
Que plus mi tra· l cor ves amor <br> <br>

(It’s no wonder if I sing better than any other singer, for my heart draws me more towards love…).</em> </blockquote> It is a love lyric — as if to suggest that the insurgence of brilliant violence, in the lines below, might emerge from a hope rooted in solidarity, an outpouring of love for country and kin. Lurçat’s is perhaps a sentimental gesture, to us today perhaps politically naive (the violence experienced by postwar France, as it recovered from devastation and struggled to hold on to its colonial possessions, was often nothing but that — brute violence). Nevertheless, what other response could there be to the breaking of the Nazi grip over the City of Lights? The tapestry’s insistence on luminousness extends from the text to the motifs to the sheen of its texture: the clarity and precision of its colour, the richness of its weave. It extends to Lurçat’s intuitive grasp, and development, of the forms and patterns of gothic art. The iridescence of a cubist composition and that of an illuminated manuscript find, here as in the rest of Lurçat’s work, a common language. <br> <br>

This luminousness brightens, even dematerialises, the single solid brick wall of the Bracken library on which the tapestry is hung. De Gaulle’s gift was characteristically astute: Lurçat’s tapestry works productively with the grand modernism of Richard Sheppard’s Bracken library, an architecture which looks towards open space and sunlight as its primary material. Lurçat himself saw tapestry as an art which — in a crucial difference from oil painting — was fundamentally allied to architecture. What the frame was to an oil painting, the walls of a building were to a piece of tapestry. Furthermore, a work of tapestry, to Lurçat, was fundamentally a work of scale. As he wrote in his treatise <em>Designing Tapestry</em>: ‘...I want to remind you that tapestry knew its proudest moments at a time when a style of extremely grandiose architecture reigned supreme… it was at a time when so many voluptuous buildings were rising up out of the earth in the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries, that France seemed to be no less than a workshop of the gods where so many buildings sprang into existence, where stone was formed into flying buttresses, curved and bent, joined and even subdued to trap the light…’. <br> <br>

It is entirely appropriate, then, that such a piece of tapestry should find its home in Churchill College, the beacon of a modernist architectural wave just newly beginning to rise up out of the earth on which British universities stood. Lurçat’s tapestry’s shimmering, intricate luminous effects, counterpointing the soaring verticals of light pouring through Sheppard’s slender concrete beams, directs and structures the viewer’s gaze, lends a texture which renders justice to the gothicism of Sheppard’s craftsmanlike rationality, and exploits fully the resources of the space’s volume and grandeur to lend its subject matter the dignity that it deserves. In this place, Churchill and De Gaulle are friends. <br> <br>

./Images/t29.png,Flight,Sculpture,Library/Archives,Peter Lyon,Modernism,nil,1980s,"Peter Lyon was a sculptor, designer, writer, and teacher who attended Bryanston School, where he studied sculpture with Willi Soukop. He furthered his education at Oxford University and the Edinburgh College of Art, studying sculpture under Eric Schilsky. <br> <br>

<em>Flight</em> was created for Churchill College, during Lyon's time as resident artist at Churchill College from 1979 to 1981. It is an abstract cast bronze sculpture. Currently located by the entrance of Jock Colville Hall, placed beside Door by Geoffery Clarke, it was moved to its current location from the Fellow’s Garden around the 2000s. <em>Flight</em> is a remarkable example of how Lyon captures grace, fluidity and dynamism in a static medium. The grace and elegance of the sculpture is felt as an offset of gravity, the sculpture's thin and sharp edges creating an illusion of movement, a sense of gliding through the skies. <br> <br>"

./Images/t31.png,Broken Butterfies,Sculpture,West of Great Court,Thomas Kiesewetter,Abstraction,2011,2000s,"Thomas Kiesewetter is a contemporary German sculptor known for his abstract and dynamic metal works. Born in 1963, Kiesewetter studied at the Hochschule der Künste in Berlin. His works, including <em>Broken Butterflies</em>, feature intricate, geometric forms crafted from corten steel. <em>Broken Butterflies</em> is situated on the grass between Cowan Court and South Court. <br> <br>

Kiesewetter explores the boundaries of definitions and the beauty created through juxtapositions. His sculpture exists at the boundaries between solid and void, stability and fragility, movement and stillness. <em>Broken Butterflies</em> is a spatial interplay between what is considered solid and void. As the viewer walks around the work, areas or pockets of space disclose themselves: what at first glance seems solid may later on reveal itself to be void. From afar the sculpture appears stable: a pile of solid metal forms. However, closer, in-person observation reveals fragility exploding through the sculpture's ‘unfinished’ detail connections, skewed edges, unsealed eagles and, most importantly, a ‘rusted’, weathered look. <br> <br>

The sculpture is composed of triangular prisms of various sizes interlaced together, forming an meticulous relationship which showcases Kiesewetter’s abstract and dynamic style. In juxtaposition to the intricate relationship created by its intersecting elements, the connections between these elements are formed from coarse screws and visible remains of welds which hold the sculpture together. These crude edges and connections add to the detailing of the sculpture: the name <em>Broken Butterflies</em> itself suggests reminiscences of machine art and constructivism. <em>Broken Butterlfies</em> rests on the moment before collapse, a stillness suffused with the concern of a movement which may occur any second in the future. <br> <br>

<em>Broken Butterflies</em> offers what the artist calls a '360 mal vorn', or '360 frontal view' of the sculpture. This means that there is no front or back to the sculpture: rather, the work is designed to be seen as a frontal view all around. Kiesewetter explores momentum as articulated through impulsive forces, experienced as shapes emerging and growing beyond their immobile limits into a rhythm of continuous, eruptive, animate, language. <br> <br>

As its name also suggests, <em>Broken Butterflies</em> conveys tragedy. There is something romantic about the way a certain destructive power is embodied within the construction itself, intricately but modestly presented."
./Images/t32.png,London to Paris,Sculpture,West of Great Court,Eduardo Paolozzi,Postmodernism,2000,2000s,"Eduardo Paolozzi, born in Edinburgh in 1924, was a key figure in 20th-century British art. He studied at the Edinburgh School of Art and Central St Martins, where he developed his unique artistic style. In the 1940s, Paolozzi created dada and surrealist-inspired collages that anticipated the Pop art movement. In 1952, Paolozzi co-founded the Independent Group, a collective of artists, architects, and writers whose groundbreaking work significantly influenced contemporary art, cementing Paolozzi's status as a major artist of his era. <br> <br>

<em>London to Paris</em> was inspired by Paolozzi's frequent trips between Edinburgh and Milan, a journey he would make every year between the ages of 9 and 15, changing trains at London and Paris. These memories, experiences and emotions inspired him to create a sequence of elements and objects organised into a collage sculpture representing this journey. His fascination with the relationship between man and the mechanised world is also strongly reflected in his work. A human figure with mechanistic connections has been disassembled and placed — in a deconstructivist composition, skewed from head to feet —  onto an open air railway wagon. A strand of bronze, the only organic form, creates a link between the dismembered pieces. Examining the details of the sculpture, the mechanistic connection joints follow a similar language, allowing for open interpretation of how the human figure may be composed, silently asking if there is only one possible composition. This raises the question of whether the assembled figure is the same upon arrival as compared to the dissembled figure at departure. In a way, this relates to how one may present themselves differently at different locations: for example, at Churchill College, a place of study, or at home. The journey between constitutes the dismantling and assembly of different identities. The sculpture's weathered material conveys a sense of melancholy, while the figure lies tirelessly looking up using its own body parts as support for its head. The audience is left to wonder if the melancholy is from a reluctance to leave, an unwillingness to arrive, or the discomfort of travel and the consequent switching of one's persona. <br> <br>

This surroundings of the artwork brings another perspective to the work itself. <em>London to Paris</em> is located in front of the trees halfway between the East Court and South Court of Churchill College. The two accommodation blocks resemble the destination and departure points of London and Paris. The corridor connecting East Court and South Court behind the trees resonates with the sculpture's liminality, while also providing an alternative viewing point. Passing through the corridor, branches and leaves frame the artwork as one moves ahead of the railway wagon which has been frozen in time. One embodies the moment where modern and past travels coincide. <br> <br>

Robin Day was catapulted into the public eye in large part due to high profile commissions in 1951 — specifically, Day was commissioned to furnish the seating for the Royal Festival Hall and to create designs for the Festival of Britain. In 1962, Day was commissioned by Sir John Cockroft, the Master of Churchill College, to furnish the buildings. This included all the furniture in the dining hall, which is made from oiled teak.

In 1962, Day was invited by Sir John Cockroft, the College Master, to design furniture for the college. Among these designs were the chairs and sofas for the Senior Common Room — the ‘Club Armchair’ and ‘Club Sofa’ — which eloquently convey Day’s utilitarian design principles. As he had put it in an interview conducted the year of that commission: 'A good design must fulfil its purpose well, be soundly constructed, and should express in its design this purpose and construction.’ In this, Day was enormously influenced by the Scandinavian school of design, notably by the Danish furniture designer Hans J. Wegner — of whose furniture the college possesses the largest collection outside of Denmark. These designs are now commercially available, though all models on the market have aluminium legs, unlike the original teak of the SCR furniture. "
./Images/t35.png,Curtain patterns,Furniture,Fellow's Dining Room,Robin and Lucienne Day,Modernism,1963,1960s,"In 1963, Richard Sheppard, the architect of Churchill College, commissioned Lucienne Day to design the college’s curtains. Lucienne Day was the most famous and accomplished British textile designer of her era. The pattern she designed for this commission was given the rather imposingly teutonic name of ‘Baldric’ — which, literally, refers to decorative military bands which are worn across one shoulder — possibly by analogy to its bold vertical bands of colour. Three colour variants were produced: plum (used in the Club Room), pink/orange (in the Women’s Combination Room and Common Combination Room) and grey/brown (for the rest of the college). An abstract black pattern is overlaid across these bands. As risky as interpreting this rorschach-like patch might be — a broadsword like form, hilt and all, does seem to emerge from it. In this sense, the name of Day’s design becomes all the more fitting, considering that military baldrics often hold the wearer’s sword. Starkly but richly textured, vibrant but also forbidding, there is a certain martial logic to Day's design which is perhaps surprisingly absent in many other aspects of the design, architecture and art of a college dedicated to the memory of Winston Churchill, a symbolic figure of World War II. (An exception might be the fortress-like curved wall of the stairwell linking the college’s two libraries). Lucienne Day’s design is, at least, the only one whose name invites specifically military interpretation.<br> <br>

Indeed, paying closer attention to these unassuming curtains might remind one to confront the Cold-War military tenor embedded in the college’s technocratic founding aims: Lord Tedder, when he laid the foundation stone for the college, read a message by Sir Winston Churchill which read: <blockquote><em>‘Two years ago I planted an oak on the site of the College. Since then the manifestations of the formidable advance in technology in America and Russia have multiplied. Britain must not be left behind… We must, as always before, be with the leaders. It is to further this high aim that Churchill college was founded.'</em></blockquote> How apt that it should be a woman that designed this reminder in a college which did not, until 1972, admit women.  <br> <br>

In any case, the design seems to have pleased Richard Sheppard: Lesley Jackson, in her monograph on the Days, reports that Sheppard was ‘delighted with the results, which he thought were stunning and which perfectly complemented the restrained richness of the building itself.’ The original rayon and cotton woven curtains, produced by Edinburgh Weavers, no longer survive in their original places, but careful reproductions can be found in the Fellow’s Dining Hall.<br> <br>

Wegner (1914-2007), the Danish son of a cobbler, was one of the most acclaimed furniture designers of the 20th century. When the Danish industrialist Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller decided to establish a Centre for Continuing Education at Churchill College, he commissioned Wegner, by then already a legend of Scandinavian design, to furnish the building. The elegant Møller chair was specifically designed by Wegner for this commission. It combines elements of two of Wegner’s previous designs, the PP112 and PP240 chairs — as per Møller’s personal request."
./Images/t37.png,Peacock Chair,Furniture,Møller Center,Hans J Wegner,Modernism,1947,1940s,"Created in the late 1940s, there is something oddly art-deco about the flamboyant Peacock chair, one of legendary Danish furniture designer Hans J. Wegner’s first truly iconic chairs. There is something about the design's expressive confidence, its naturalistic geometry, that puts this modern design firmly in the world of the feathered flapper. Wegner gives his imagination expression with an admirable economy: his conception of the spindles as vectors of force rather than support, the expansive energy generated by the interplay of the back's two arcs: that of the wooden frame and the thicker portions of the peacock-feather spindles. It is perhaps fitting that this chair has found its way into the stock of the furniture in the Møller Centre at Churchill College: it is, after all, ultimately a spunky update on the 18th-century English Windsor chair. Indeed, in the 1950s, the BBC purchased this model, prominently displaying it on screen in the interval between programs. This most British piece of Danish furniture certainly seems to be at home at Churchill."

Wegner (1914-2007), the Danish son of a cobbler, was one of the most acclaimed furniture designers of the 20th century. With its air of understated, ascetic elegance, the Round Chair was possibly the chair that put Wegner — and Danish design — on the map. In 1960, the chair featured in the first televised US presidential debate between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, further boosting its profile. A modified version can be found in the furniture stock of the Møller Centre. Its presence in the college — which houses the largest collection of Wegner’s furniture outside of his native Denmark — is a fitting reminder of the college architecture’s indebtedness to the Nordic school of design for which this chair served almost as a shorthand."

Wegner (1914-2007), the Danish son of a cobbler, was one of the most acclaimed furniture designers of the 20th century. The wishbone chair, inspired by Ming-era Chinese furniture, is one of his most iconic and commercially successful designs, its svelte outline conveying an elegant lightness of touch. This chair was included in the college’s first stock of furniture, adorning the college buttery."
./Images/t40.png,Flag Halyard Chair,Furniture,Møller Center,Hans J Wegner,Modernism,1950,1950s,"Hans J. Wegner (1914-2007), the Danish son of a cobbler, was one of the most acclaimed furniture designers of the 20th century. Almost stereotypically 50s — Hans J. Wegner’s Flag Halyard chair is uncharacteristically wiry, metallic and polygonal. Characteristically, however, the chair’s form developed from ergonomic experimentation. Wegner had the idea for the unique sitting position one experiences in the Flag Halyard chair — somewhere between sitting and reclining — while digging himself into a sand dune while on holiday with his family (indeed, the chair’s outline even resembles a shell one might pick up on the seaside). The chair features a blend of materials unique for its time: the tempering of the chair’s cold metal frame with the titular flag halyard weave (the twining technique on this chair was invented by Wegner himself) adds a craftsmanlike touch. In this sense — the use of earthy material to temper severe and rational forms — the chair sits easily in Churchill College’s brick-brutalist idiom, which itself drew inspiration, in part, from the modernist experiments of the Nordic (albeit Finnish) architect Aalvar Alto. Today, one model of the chair, luxuriously chusioned, can be found in the Møller Centre, which Wegner was commissioned to furnish. "
./Images/t41.png,Coventry Chairs,Furniture,Chapel,Gordon Russell,Modernism,1960,1960s,"These chairs, designed by the renowned British furniture designer Sir Sydney Gordon Russell (1892 - 1980), were commissioned by Basil Spence to furnish his famous Coventry Cathedral: one of the architectural miracles of postwar Britain. Fittingly, Spence was among the panel of judges of the original architectural competition which selected Sheppard Robson’s winning design. More modest in scale but taking a similar approach to materiality, the chapel at Churchill is furnished by this very same chair. Balancing a sturdy, ascetic geometry with an inviting human touch in the slight ergonomic dip of the seat, the chair is in perfect harmony with the chapel’s architectural principles. "

./Images/t43.png,Aerial photograph of site,Landscaping,nil,nil,nil,1959,1950s,"This aerial photograph of the site on which Churchill College was to be built was taken in 1959, the year of its purchase. Below (West) — the University Observatory. The board of Trustees paid £82,500 for the site, or around £1.6 million in 2024, at £2000 per acre. The expansion of the University into this area would radically alter the landscape. The striking, lone tree, standing in the ditch which separated the land owned by St John’s college and privately-held agricultural land, was an elm — which sadly had to be felled to make way for the new college buildings."
./Images/t44.png,Site survey,Landscaping,nil,"J. Carter, Jonas & Sons",nil,1958,1950s,"This survey of the site upon which Churchill college would later be built was drafted by J. Carter, Jonas & Sons in 1958, presented to the Board of Trustees which had been assembled to found the new institution before their purchase of the land. The eastern field, marked in red, was then owned by St. John’s College, and was being used as a Nursery Garden. The vast majority of the site, however (marked in yellow), was arable land, then under private ownership, where wheat and barley was farmed. Curious to observe, as well, was what the surveyors described as ‘a hollow, now filled with miscellaneous trees and undergrowth, which is the remaining evidence of an old gravel pit’. The survey is a fascinating window into the diverse ways in which generations human activity had already shaped the contours of the site before it would be definitively transformed by the future Churchill College.

./Images/t45.png,College Under Construction,Buildings,nil,nil,nil,nil,1960s,"This photograph, taken from an illustrated leaflet produced by Rattee & Kent, building contractors at the college, shows the progress of the building work on North Court — the second building to go up after the completion of the Sheppard Flats, pictured top right. It is a wonderful angle from which to view this most underrated but bewildering pieces of architecture on college grounds: the rationalism of the plan made visible and volumetric. The shaping of the elevation of the playing fields — a priority for the college’s first master, Sir John Cockroft — is evident, and the finish of the grounds form a dramatic contrast with the carved-out earthworks on the main site. Also visible in the lower left is the mound along Madingley Road, planned by landscape architect Sheila Haywood, taking shape. The state of the soil as a result of the building works would later cause issues for her: after construction, the soil on site had become compacted and waterlogged."
./Images/t46.png,Madingley Road Mound,Landscaping,nil,Sheila Haywood,nil,1959,1950s,"The mound and foliage which screen the college along Madingley road, forming its southern boundary, was present in the plans for the college’s landscape from the beginning. Sheppard Robson’s original 1958 report on the design objectives for the college makes this quite clear: ‘Nearly the whole of the Madingley Road perimeter of the site is planted with trees to form a screen between the new college buildings and this main traffic route’. In 1959, Sheila Haywood, then a significant figure in post-war landscape architecture, came on to the Churchill College project as its lead landscape consultant and architect. Her 1959 proposal for this tree screen included rows of caucasian lime trees (thirty-one total tilia x euchlora) which would be held between two sets of four oriental planes (Platanus orientalis), broken up by willows (twenty-seven total salix coerulea), and, interestingly, temporary interplanting of balsam poplar (populus trichocarpa) to act as screening while the limes and oriental planes grew over the next 10-15 years. <br> <br>

This planting was undertaken between 1959-60 and the shaping of the mound completed with the end of construction in 1969. Unfortunately, as Paula Laycock recounts in her book on the college grounds, most of the non-native trees had died by 1998, and were replaced with native trees. In addition, the slopes of the bank were re-sown, incorporating wildflowers. Nonetheless, the general shape of the plan — of a shapely, verdant screen elegantly punctuated by the romantic forms of the willows — remains surprisingly intact. The mound is as practical as it is picturesque: blocking the noise of traffic and, with the ditch which runs along the perimeter, unobtrusively establishing the boundary between the college and the world beyond. At the same time, this frame is planted in a way that integrates the college in the wider landscape: as Haywood explains in a typed document accompanying her plan, her selection of deciduous trees were to ‘give some continuity with the trees further up Madingley Road’. In a way, the mound acts not unlike a ha-ha, though lacking a built wall. This spray of wilderness, straight out of the playbook of the great eighteenth-century English landscape gardeners, serves as a wonderful frame for the geometrical forms of the brick-and-concrete South Court buildings, which just about peek through. Indeed, the wilderness is not altogether artificial: this narrow band today forms part of a designated wildlife corridor.
"
./Images/t47.png,Sheila Haywood’s 1959 Master Planting Plan,Landscaping,nil,Sheila Haywood,nil,1959,1950s,"In 1959, Sheila Haywood, then a significant figure in post-war landscape architecture, came on to the Churchill College project as its lead landscape consultant and architect. Her planting plan for the college was a simple but effective one: in her own words the main College buildings were ‘designed to be held in a framework of evergreen oaks, mahonia squifolium and clipped box’. (unfortunately, the oak was not to fare too well over the next few years, many falling victim to the extremely harsh winter of 1963) This framework hugs the contours of the site, providing privacy while providing a natural counterpoint to the geometrical forms of the college architecture: it is a frame which allows the buildings to breathe. Unimposing, responding to the architectural division of space — the planting makes this division seem almost natural. Most striking are the trees which were originally to be planted between the sporting grounds, abandoned when the plans for the courts were downscaled. Today, the uninterrupted westward view towards the chapel and the sporting grounds provides a sense of freedom which is one of the most valuable characteristics of the Churchill College site — the only one with its sports fields integrated into the main site.

The levelling and re-surfacing of the ground — the soil is of a heavy clay — was also a key part of the landscaping. Various parties had a stake in this: Sir John Cockroft, the college’s first master, was anxious that the ground be levelled and treated to grow turf for the playing fields in time for the college’s opening in October 1961, even before the outcome of the architectural competition for the design of the college was known. Today, the elevation of the grounds in the college continues to bear evidence to a curious artifact of the college’s planning: a proposed road which would have traversed the west side of the college, linking the Huntingdon and Madingley Roads. It is visible in Haywood’s plan of 1959 (and bordered by some trees), but was never built. Nonetheless, a vestige of this road remains in the contouring of this section of the site, which is more elevated, and a faint outline of the original route can be seen in satellite images. It is an axis, partly hugging this contour, which service vehicles travelling to and from the college’s refuse area use.

In any case, the bird’s-eye perspective that a plan like this affords can be deceiving: Sheila Haywood did not have local control over planting everywhere in the college, about which those who lived and worked there, such as Sir John Cockroft and then-Bursar of the college, Major-General J R C (Jack) Hamilton, also had a say. As had always been the case, the landscape of the college was shaped through a constant negotiation between the varying needs and wants of the people who occupied the space. It is nonetheless significant that a large extent of this shaping was planned by a woman — in a college which would remain male-only until 1972.

./Images/t48.png,Planting plan for courtyard,Landscaping,nil,Sheila Haywood,nil,1959,1950s,"In 1959, Sheila Haywood, then a significant figure in post-war landscape architecture, came on to the Churchill College project as its lead landscape consultant and architect. This ambitious planting plan of hers, for one of the sunken beds of the concrete courts, speaks to the level of detail of her plans. Writing to the college’s architect Richard Sheppard on the planting of the courtyards in 1962, Haywood emphasised the role of planting in providing a counterpoint to the modernist architecture, suggesting planting in the courts which would be kept ‘very green and feathery, by way of contrast with the solidity of the paving and surrounds’. It is a philosophy she adhered to on every level of the plan. Haywood had also envisioned a scheme which would articulate Richard Sheppard’s original architectural vision, that of a ‘sequence’ of ‘linked rectangular semi-enclosures [...] the identity of each being recognisable by its particular shape, size, proportion or contents’. The same letter reveals her interest in the variety of planting across courts: ‘I think two trees is plenty in this court, and the other court I think will be best in plain grass only, with no planting whatever’. At the same time, she was careful not to overdo variety in planting in favour of preserving the coherence of the overall scheme. In a later letter of August 1963, for instance, discussing the replacement of certain plants in the sunken beds, Haywood commented, ‘I should be sorry to see much more variety introduced, as I think it is essential to retain the existing broad scale.’"
./Images/t49.png,Car Park Planting,Landscaping,Churchill Road,Sheila Haywood,nil,1963,1960s,"In 1959, Sheila Haywood, then a significant figure in post-war landscape architecture, came on to the Churchill College project as its lead landscape consultant and architect. These proposed plans for planting just outside the car park, drawn up by her in 1963, were a relatively minor part of her overall scheme, but demonstrate the consistency of her guiding architectural principles on the project: softening the architecture, providing privacy and allowing nature to frame open space, and integrating the college into the pre-existing natural landscape. ‘I have suggested Cornish elms which are a fairly neat kind of small elm much used for street planting,’ she wrote in a letter of 1963, ‘as I thought they would help to carry over the idea of elms from the opposite side of the road and give the feeling that the road was passing through a small copse’."
./Images/t50.png,North Border Planting,Landscaping,nil,Sheila Haywood,nil,1959,1950s,"In 1959, Sheila Haywood, then a significant figure in post-war landscape architecture, came on to the Churchill College project as its lead landscape consultant and architect. Haywood’s plan for planting along the northern border, today the border along Churchill Road, sought to incorporate and complement the pre-existing elms on the site. For this, Haywood favoured an alternation of elms with very different trees: the feathery cut-leafed alder (Alnus Laciniata), solid birch, and bushy cotoneaster, all underplanted with shrubs."
./Images/t51.png,1965 Planting Plan,Landscaping,nil,Sheppard Robson,nil,1965,1960s,"What is most striking about this planting plan is surely the proposed grid of Norway maple trees (Acer Platanoides)— labelled ‘A’ — between South Court and the main Wolfson/library building. Later plans seem to suggest that this planting was not actually carried out, but their presence here is interesting all the same. Drawn up by employees of Sheppard Robson in 1965, during the construction of West Court: the last stage of building on the main accommodation site. It was in this year that it was known that the originally-planned second wing of West Court which would have closed off the ring of courts and cut off the playing fields from the rest of the college, was not to be built. In the words of Bursar Major-General J R C (Jack) Hamilton, there had been a change of plan. Perhaps these trees were intended to serve the corresponding role of controlling the sight-lines between the vast expanses of the playing fields and the main courts, now that the fourth wall of the quadrangle was down. They would compensate and add a sense of privacy and protection to an inner court which now seemed more exposed; it would interrupt a space that might now have seemed too continuous, providing a sense of visual interest along the path from within the great quadrangle to the fields. The tentative planning of two tulip trees (Liriodendron tulipifera) — labelled C — in the lower corners of West Court, when no others were planted in this pattern in any of the other courts, seem to betray this sense of the planting making up for something no longer there.

Perhaps more suggestive than definitive about the exact arrangement of these trees, the grid-like layout of the planning contrasts noticeably with that of the college’s chief landscape architect, Sheila Haywood. In Haywood’s plans, trees are laid out more irregularly, in patterns which suggest constellations more than they do grids, in ways which respond to the shape of existing terrain. If planted, these rows of Norwegian maple would have stood out in contrast to Haywood’s overall scheme. In any case — this did not happen, though this plan remains a fascinating document of the ways landscape design might adapt to, and sometimes aspire to make up for, changes in the built environment."
./Images/t52.png,David Thurlow Sketches,Landscaping,Churchill Road,David Thurlow,nil,? 90s,1990s,"These sketches of the view down Churchill Road (the entrance to the Møller Center carpark can be spotted in the bottom right) were executed by David Thurlow in [the 1990s], a prominent figure in Cambridge architecture who contributed numerous designs to the college: most notably, the design of the new wing of the Archives Centre to house Margaret Thatcher’s papers, and the Study Centre. Interesting to see is the foliage by the curve in the road which would later make way for the new music and study centre extension in 2007. It is an architect’s response to the landscape: Thurlow takes an interest in the play and interaction between round and jagged, feathery forms in the foliage, studying the rhythms generated by this variance in the verticals. With an economy of forceful, expressive strokes he strips down the scene to its essentials. The sketch which holds the most architectural interest is perhaps the sketch on the top left, which seems to be set just to the side of the carpark and garages. A massive, irregular tree form — presumably the majestic Huntingdon Elm which had been standing in that spot since 1959 (and survives to this day) — disrupts the ordered progression of the three circular forms of the trees in front of it: a dark mass mediates between and balances the two. It is almost as if a different sort of pictorial logic, momentarily suspended from linear perspective, dominated instead by considerations of shape and shade, is in play in this region of the sketch. Here is another way in which the counterpointing between landscape frame and framed buildings — as conceived by the college’s original landscape architect, Sheila Haywood — can be understood. The semi-natural forms of the planting enhances the architectural landscape precisely by subverting its logic."
./Images/t53.png,Churchill Road Planting Plan,Landscaping,Churchill Road,Gordon Patterson,nil,1993,1990s,"These planting plans for Churchill road were drawn up by Gordon Patterson, who was the College Consultant Landscape Architect from 1992-1998. Among the first projects in college was the reshaping of the Churchill Road border of the college. The shrubs initially planted according to the plan of Sheila Haywood — the college’s original landscape architect — had become overgrown and misshapen. In this plan Patterson stuck closely to Haywood’s original intentions — picking shrubs similar to those Haywood had selected in her original plan."
./Images/t54.png,Churchill Oak + Randolph Churchill's tulip tree,Landscaping,Jock Colville Lawn,nil,nil,1959,1950s,"The majestic oak tree which stands on the Jock Colville Lawn was the first tree planted on site — by Sir Winston Churchill himself, nearly on the eve of his 85th birthday. The symbolic planting ceremony — marking the birth of a new Cambridge college — took place 17 October 1959. The mulberry tree in East Court was also planted by Churchill on this same occasion. Next to the oak on the Jock Colville Lawn also stands a Tulip tree planted by the Hon. Randolph Churchill — Sir Winston’s son — in 1965.

Still standing tall today, these trees root the landscape of the college in a palpable sense of history. Though these may be the most famous ones on the site — they remind us that each individual tree on the site is very much alive, each contributes its own story to the ever-branching canopy of the college’s heritage. As Churchill himself reflected in his concluding remarks to his speech made during the planting ceremony, ‘I trust and believe that this College, this seed that we have sown, will grow to shelter and nurture generations who may add most notably to the strength and happiness of our people, and to the knowledge and peaceful progress of the world. “The mighty oak from an acorn towers; A tiny seed can fill a field with flowers.”’"
./Images/t55.png,Cowan Court Birch,Landscaping,Cowan Court,"Jonathan Cook Landscape Architecture, 6a architects",nil,2016,2000s,"There is a sense in which Cowan Court itself is part of the landscape. With its ‘timber brutalist’ aesthetic (the external cladding is of oak salvaged from the floors of French freight trains) and curved walls which, as the lead architect on the project Tom Emerson put it, represent ‘a kind of receiving of the open landscape’. A type of ‘landscape building’, according to the architect, Cowan Court is designed to sink into the surrounding landscape itself. An aesthetic integration into the environment is just one way in which Cowan Court embodies the ideal of sustainable building. If the building self-effaces from the outside, entering the courtyard feels almost transformative. There is something almost religious about these ethereal, slender, feathery silver birch trees — appropriate for decorating what is at its heart a monastic quadrangle. The density of trees, unusual for a Churchill court, contributes to the sense of the courtyard as a hermetic slice of a self-contained ecosystem, a sort of mini-forest. Below the soil, rainwater collected on the roof drains through the gulleys into underground storage tanks for irrigation: another example of sustainable design."
./Images/t56.png,Wolfson Flats Gardens,Landscaping,Wolfson Flats,David Roberts,nil,1965,1960s,"The landscaping for the Wolfson Flats was not undertaken by Sheila Haywood, who landscaped the rest of the college, but by the Flats’ architects themselves — David Roberts Architects. Perhaps the fact that this property sat on the site of Whittingham Lodge, which was divided from the main site by Churchill Road (then known simply as the Private Road), and that the project was built under a very tight budget, made this a sensible option. In Roberts’ plan, the central open courtyard is conspicuously empty, possibly because there were still plans to build a pool in the area until this idea was finally shot down in 1966. The actual planting plan here is thus minimal — concentrated mainly on the open space between the existing house on Whittingham Lodge (still standing today) and the new flats. Today, the common courtyard, which incorporates a playground area, is thankfully more generously-planted. A row of trees and a hedge closes up the front of the courtyard, providing the residents with greater privacy than in Roberts’ initial plan."
./Images/t57.png,Pepper Potts Cherry trees,Landscaping,Pepperpots,John Moore,nil,2002,2000s,"Tucked away in the postgraduate accommodation area, lining the lawn of the Pepperpots houses, are a set of lovely and delicate cherry trees, an unexpected but delightful departure from the solid, earthy planting on the main site. Originally, the architect of the houses had called for an apple orchard to be planted here, having designed, according to Head Gardener John Moore, feature windows where one could look down onto flat tops of trees. Seeking to reduce the impact of the gardens on surrounding properties, and knowing from experience that the apples would attract wasps when they fell, Moore suggested replacing the apple trees in the scheme with these lighter cherry trees, which similarly would grow to a flat top."

The view from East Court to the library buildings feels largely unchanged. The concrete pillar is sketched in a way which makes it seem almost organic: all around, artist Jenny Saunders has integrated the textures of the built environment into that of the landscape. "
./Images/t59.png,Sketch of Hepworth and students after exam,Prints,Great Court,Jenny Sanders,nil,1985,1980s,"This sketch was commissioned by the College in 1985 in connection with a fundraising appeal. The brickwork, wonderfully articulated, has clearly captured the artist’s attention. Prominently featured lounging next to the Hepworth, in this idyllic scene, are female undergraduates among their male counterparts: it had scarcely been over a decade since women had been admitted to the college for the first time. Soft, curved edges and texturing integrates the built into the natural environment: the Hepworth, here, could almost be taken for stone."
